The author, a native of Philadelphia and an alumnus of Chamberlain's alma mater, spent four years researching and interviewing the most important people in Wilt's life to produce these results.</p><p>There are celebrities and so-called legends. And then there is Wilton Norman Chamberlain, unique and unforgettable, and one of the 20th century&#x2019;s greatest and most controversial athletes.<p>Wilt: Larger than Life examines Chamberlain&#x2019;s fascinating story, delving into his life both on and off the basketball court, and spanning his childhood to his death in 1999. The author spent four years crisscrossing the country researching Wilt&#x2019;s life and gathering stories from the most important people in it. The result is the most thorough and entertaining book ever written about this American icon, a worthy addition to the annals of sports biographies.</p><p>Among those interviewed were Wilt&#x2019;s longtime lawyer, doctor, and accountant; many of Wilt&#x2019;s other male and female friends and associates; and his basketball teammates, coaches, and opponents at every level of his momentous career. This is a portrait of Wilt that relatively few people, except family and friends, have ever seen. Wilt covers Chamberlain&#x2019;s stupendous athletic achievements, including the memorable basketball battles with Bill Russell, Willis Reed, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but equally compelling is the portrayal of the private Wilt and his unique lifestyle. Included in this in-depth look at the man and his life are a "tour" through his amazing home; vignettes of the beach volleyball life to which he was attracted; the sports teams he sponsored; the notorious claim of making love to twenty thousand women and the related issue of why he never married; his days (and nights) after his retirement from basketball; and his sad final weeks. Here, finally, is a biography that does justice to the myth and the man that was Wilt.</p><b>Robert Cherry</b>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;journalist and&nbsp;a former&nbsp;Peace Corps volunteer in the West African bush.

After a day spent in directing operations on the battlefield Father Joseph would pass the night in prayer, or in composing spiritual guidance for the nuns in his care. He was an aspirant to sainthood, a practising mystic, yet his ruthless exercise of power succeeded in prolonging the Thirty Years War, with all its unspeakable horrors. How a religious man could lead such a life, how an individual could reconcile the seemingly opposing moral systems of religion and politics, was a theme to which Huxley would continuously return.</p><p><p>xley /f Aldous /i Leonard</p>&#34;Penetrating and vivid...

In the Swiss Alps, where it is set, a hundred years is just the blink of an eye. We see in her the daughter that every mother dreams of having and every little girl dreams of being. Her presence makes us happy, and so her story has endured. This deluxe Children&#x2019;s Classic edition is produced with high-quality, leatherlike binding with gold stamping, full-color covers, colored endpapers with a book nameplate. Some of the other titles in this series include: Anne of Green Gables, Black Beauty, King Arthur and His Knights, Little Women, and The Secret Garden.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Thin Red Line</h2><p>C-for-Charlie, an Army rifle company, struggles against death, depression, and cowardice during the invasion of Guadalcanal</p><p>An old Midwestern saying goes, "There's only a thin red line between the sane and the mad." War seems to stretch that line almost to the breaking point. James Jones's classic World War II novel recounts with brutal honesty the stories of the men of C-for-Charlie Company as they struggle to hold on to their honor, their sanity, and their lives on Guadalcanal. Actor Joe Mantegna turns in an able performance, his voice expressing a roller coaster of emotions (though his Welsh accent may require some patience). Whether or not you agree with Jones that war is the "most heroic of all human endeavors," this recording will move you. (Running time: 6 hours, 4 cassettes) <i>--C.B.

Gail developed all the recipes in the book and styled all the food for the photographs, which Laura photographed. The book was designed and laid out by Laura.<b> TOUCHED BY LYME: New cookbook provides road map for Lyme Inflammation Diet</b><br><br> Most people dealing with Lyme eventually come face to face with the need to improve their diet. It may include going gluten-free, and/or eliminating assorted other food allergens, and/or finding ways to incorporate more organic, fresh produce into their daily meals. The simple fact is, what you eat has a tremendous effect on how well you can fight back from chronic illness. However, it s also a fact that, when you re sick, it can seem well-nigh impossible to make fundamental changes in your diet.<br><br> <i>Recipes for Repair: a Lyme Disease Cookbook</i> (Peconic Publishing, 2010), by Gail and Laura Piazza, can help. Some background:<br><br> Laura Piazza, a graphic designer and photographer, struggled for years with what turned out to be Lyme disease and coinfections. Once she was finally appropriately diagnosed and undergoing treatment, she came across Dr. Kenneth Singleton s informative book, The Lyme Disease Solution. (FYI, I highly recommend this book for any Lyme patient.)<br><br> She was particularly drawn to Chapter 5, in which Dr. Singleton discusses what he calls the Lyme Inflammation Diet. Wanting to give her body its best shot at healing, she decided to give the diet a try. Lucky for her, her mom was uniquely qualified to give her a hand. Gail Piazza is a professional home economist and cook, with a long track record of developing recipes for high profile clients. Laura emailed her mom a list of foods she was supposed to eat, and her mom sent her back suggested recipes. That was the beginning of what eventually became this book, which the pair created in partnership with Dr. Singleton.<br><br> Recipes for Repair takes Dr. Singleton s dietary guidelines and puts them into practice. The book explains about chronic inflammation, the role it plays in Lyme disease, and the importance of an anti-inflammatory diet. It shows how to incorporate the diet into your life, and gives some basic food preparation tips. But the heart of the book is Part 3, the recipes.<br><br> Coupled with gorgeous photographs, the recipes should appeal to anyone seeking wholesome food. No sense of deprivation here. And no need for the cook to be preparing two different menus for people with different health status.<br><br> The book even includes some special treats suitable for holiday entertaining. Bon appetite. --Dorothy Kupcha Leland, California Lyme Disease Association</p><h2>Dragondrums (Argo Book)</h2><p>Drafted by Masterharper Robinton to help with political work, Piemur travels to faraway places, is tempted to steal a queen dragon lizard egg, wakes up on a different continent, and must use his wits to survive</p><p>Anne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

She was born nearby, bought it in 1938, and spent all her summers there until her death in 1976. It was, she wrote, the loveliest house in the world.&#x201d; Greenway makes a thinly disguised appearance in at least two of her novels, and nearby settings also play a crucial role in her books. This book explores and illustrates the significance of Devon in Christie&#x2019;s work, and of Greenway in particular its magnificent gardens, its beautiful setting on the estuary, and her relationship with its servants and staff. Richly illustrated with rare archival images and evocative photographs of Greenway and the surrounding countryside, <i>Agatha Christie at Home</i> is a delightful look at the life and work of the world&#x2019;s best-selling novelist.</p><p>Hilary Macaskill is a journalist and travel writer. She was formerly a publisher, a publicity manager for publishing companies and a lecturer in journalism at City University. She lives in London.<br>The top best-selling author of all time (rivaling Shakespeare), Agatha Christie (1890-1976) had as many as eight homes at one time. Some were in London, and one was in Baghdad. Her favorite however--the one she felt was her true home for her and her husband, gave her the most inspiration, and is most associated with her mysteries--was Greenway in the county of Devon. A series of previous homes beginning with her childhood home and including rentals and changing homes as her career grew leads up to the stately Greenway. Though not a grand English estate which Christie could have lived in, Greenway was a small mansion. The presence of servants seemed natural; and Christie furnished and decorated the home with all types of Victorian objects. Her sensibility was always more Victorian than modern. She called one modernist building where she rented an apartment at one time "an ocean liner."<br><br>Though Greenway was the center of Christie's life, sensibilities, and ideas for her mysteries, this was so because it was situated in the midst of a traditionally English country environment (which to a large degree survives today). The book is organized so circles of this are seen as both extending from and enclosing Greenway. Each circle of the larger surrounding environment--town, county, parish--is perused as if enriching the atmosphere of Greenway--thus casting a light into the sources of Christie's works and her particular creativity.<br><br>In citing physical features such as rivers and hills and man-made parts such as shops and roads in delving into the widening circles of town, etc., Macaskill notes these as they appeared in different Christie mysteries. Even when names or some details have been changed for the sake of fictionalizing them, they are nonetheless apparent; for despite her bottomless imagination and numerous mystery novels, Christie never did stray far from the ideas and materials she found at Greenway and its environs.<br><br>The color photographs on nearly every page (80 of the total of 110 photos) are pleasing photos of Devon known for its Mediterranean-like climate. That they are connected with the popular author Agatha Christie adds immeasurable interest to them however.

That is only one item of scandalous interest in an autobiography that resembles Billie Holiday's Lady Sings the Blues in its startling, brutal honesty. But, unlike celebrity autobiographies that mistake "juicy" anecdotes for self-revelation, Dancing on My Grave is also an intellectually stimulating portrait of the artist at war with tradition, with family, friends, lovers and colleagues, but most frustratingly, with herself. The 34-year-old Kirkland, who triumphed at the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater in the 1970s, reveals her one-time addiction to cocaine; that her affair with dancer Patrick Bissell was predicated on their mutual addiction to the drug; that both her romantic and artistic relationships with Baryshnikov were untenable because of his adolescent and unrelenting narcissism ("How was it possible that Misha's resources as an artist, so evident in performance, were different from those of his basic personality?"); that in 1981 she committed herself to a Westchester psychiatric hospital, even as she knew that her anorexia, bulimia and drug addiction were only symptoms of deeper emotional problems. The memoir also serves as a devastating critique of the American dance establishment that cannot be ignored. New York City Ballet founder George Balanchine (who gave Kirkland amphetamine "vitamins" on a tour of the U.S.S.R.) emerges as patronizing, vindictive, petty but still a genius. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, Kirkland nearly paid with her life for "the passivity and guilt instilled by the Balanchine system"a dance theater that valued speed and form over dramatic content. "Don't think, dance," Kirkland was told. The ballerina's disaffection with that dictum is at the heart of this book: "To speak through the dance, to articulate something beyond the steps, was the precise art for which I struggled." Kirkland spares neither the reader nor herself in this memoir full of poetic insights into art and life, and we must be grateful that the dancer, always "seen but not heard," has at last given her inner soul voice in this magnificent autobiography. 50,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Prima ballerina Kirkland and her husband have written an emotional diatribe about Kirkland's dance career. The ballet equivalent of a "tell-it-all" Hollywood biography, this is a horror story of pain, anorexia, emotional difficulties, and casual sex, culminating in four years of cocaine addiction that brought her career to a standstill. At odds with both Balanchine and Baryshnikov in her insistence on putting her own dramatic interpretation into her roles, she is highly critical of Balanchine's training methods and Baryshnikov's partnering skills, which she says lacked finesse both on and off the stage. Her serious accusations that ballet training produces mindless mechanical dolls, and that the rigors of the life drive dancers to drug abuse, are undermined by her shrill, fragmented tone, making this a sad self-justification.

From that fateful radioactive bite in the science hall up to Spidey 2099, DK's <i>Ultimate Guide</i> recounts all the career milestones--major and minor--of Stan Lee's web-slinging wall-crawler. Organized and authored by Tom DeFalco, former Marvel editor in chief and the series' bestselling author, this guide pulls together the storyline's many twists and turns (chronologically, by decade) and devotes big spreads to nearly every noteworthy ally, friend, and villain (with one curious omission in the Shocker). Special sections cover episodes like the alien costume, the regrettable clone saga, and the wedding to Mary Jane, while panel after panel of original art (over 600 images in all) flesh out the action (a particular treat with the corny old dialogue and art).<p> DeFalco makes some small missteps--inevitable in any fan-boy project--and certainly <i>The Ultimate Guide</i> will feel dated as the series evolves, but as a comprehensive guide, it just doesn't get any better. Throw in a foreword by the inimitable Stan Lee, and you've got a book that would make even Peter Parker proud. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Ranking as the web-slinger&#39;s top-selling comic-book author, Tom DeFalco has written about the adventures of Spider-Man and his friends for over 20 years. At one point, he was even Marvel&#39;s Editor-in-Chief. Other titles Tom has written for Marvel include Fantastic Four: Nobody Gets Out Alive and Thor: Alone among the Celestials.

They are not &#x2018;neurotics&#x2019; as they have been labelled for so long. However, high sensitivity can lead them to cease to engage with the outside world.</p><p>The book offers solutions for a happy and fulfilling life. Particularly in the way an HSP perceives his or herself: the book helps to &#x2018;reframe&#x2019; past events, such as a difficult childhood, or how they see themselves &#x2013; ie. shy.</p><p>Particularly strong material for those raising a sensitive child</p></p><p>Are you an HSP? Are you easily overwhelmed by stimuli? Affected by other people's moods? Easily startled? Do you need to withdraw during busy times to a private, quiet place? Do you get nervous or shaky if someone is observing you or competing with you? HSP, shorthand for "highly sensitive person," describes 15 to 20 percent of the population. Being sensitive is a normal trait--nothing defective about it. But you may not realize that, because society rewards the outgoing personality and treats shyness and sensitivity as something to be overcome. According to author Elaine Aron (herself an HSP), sensitive people have the unusual ability to sense subtleties, spot or avoid errors, concentrate deeply, and delve deeply. This book helps HSPs to understand themselves and their sensitive trait and its impact on personal history, career, relationships, and inner life. The book offers advice for typical problems. For example, you learn strategies for coping with overarousal, overcoming social discomfort, being in love relationships, managing job challenges, and much more. The author covers a lot of material clearly, in an approachable style, using case studies, self-tests, and exercises to bring the information home. The book is essential for you if you are an HSP--you'll learn a lot about yourself. It's also useful for people in a relationship with an HSP. <i>--Joan Price</i>"This remarkable book...gives a fresh perspective, a sigh of relief, and a good sense of where we belong in society." <br>--John Gray, author of <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i><p>"Elaine Aron's perceptive analysis of this fundamental dimension of human nature is must reading. Her balanced presentation suggests new paths for making sensitivity a blessing, not a handicap."<br>--Philip G.

Around 95% of all living species died out--a global catastrophe far greater than the dinosaurs' demise 65 million years ago. How this happened remains a mystery. But there are many competing theories. Some blame huge volcanic eruptions that covered an area as large as the continental United States; others argue for sudden changes in ocean levels and chemistry, including burps of methane gas; and still others cite the impact of an extraterrestrial object, similar to what caused the dinosaurs' extinction.</p><br><br><p> <i>Extinction</i> is a paleontological mystery story. Here, the world's foremost authority on the subject provides a fascinating overview of the evidence for and against a whole host of hypotheses concerning this cataclysmic event that unfolded at the end of the Permian.</p><br><p> After setting the scene, Erwin introduces the suite of possible perpetrators and the types of evidence paleontologists seek. He then unveils the actual evidence--moving from China, where much of the best evidence is found; to a look at extinction in the oceans; to the extraordinary fossil animals of the Karoo Desert of South Africa. Erwin reviews the evidence for each of the hypotheses before presenting his own view of what happened.</p><br><p> Although full recovery took tens of millions of years, this most massive of mass extinctions was a powerful creative force, setting the stage for the development of the world as we know it today.</p></p><p><br><p>"Douglas Erwin blends careful scholarship and graceful prose in this authoritative elucidation of Earth's greatest mass extinction.

During van Meegeren's heyday as a forger of Vermeers, he earned 50 million dollars, the acclamation of the world's press, and the satisfaction of swindling the Nazis. His canvases were so nearly authentic that they would almost certainly be prized among the catalogue of Vermeers if he had not confessed. And, no doubt, he never would have confessed at all if he hadn't been trapped in a catch-22: he had thrived so noticably during the war that when it ended, he was quickly arrested as a Nazi collaborator. His only defense was to admit that he himself had painted the remarkable "Vermeers" that had passed through his hands&#x2015;a confession the public refused to believe, until, in a huge media event, the courts staged the public painting of what would be van Meegeren's last "Vermeer." <i>I Was Vermeer </i>is an utterly gripping real-life mystery, capturing both the life of the consummate art forger, phenomenally skilled and yet necessarily unrecognized, and the equally fascinating work of the experts who identify forgeries and track down their perpetrators. Wry, amoral, irreverent, and plotted like a thriller, it is the first major book in forty years on this astonishing episode in history.</p></p><p><p>Frank Wynne is a writer and award-winning literary translator. Born in Ireland he has lived and worked in Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, London, Buenos Aires and currently lives in San Jos�, Costa Rica. He has translated more than a dozen major novels, among them the works of Michel Houellebecq, Fr�d�ric Beigbeder, Pierre M�rot and the Ivorian novelist Ahmadou Kourouma. A journalist and broadcaster, he has written for the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the <i>Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i>, <i>Melody Maker</i>, and <i>Time Out</i>.</p>In this intriguing if dry biography, Wynne recounts how Dutch forger Han van Meegeren successfully passed off more than a dozen bogus works&#x2014;including, most famously, <i>The Supper at Emmaus </i>in 1937&#x2014;as authentic Vermeers, Halses and de Hooches. Van Meegeren, who favored the style of the old Dutch masters just as modernism was hitting its stride, decided to embarrass his forward-looking critics by creating and selling his own "Vermeer." He continued his charade until he was forced to admit his crimes in 1947 while defending himself against a separate charge of treason. Wynne takes great care in explaining just how the increasingly paranoid and drug-addicted van Meegeren managed to fool the international art community, including a technical breakdown of how van Meegeren employed plastic to create the antique look of cracked <i>craquelure</i> in his canvases. Wynne also ruminates on how the arrogance of the art world&#x2014;of critics like Abraham Bredius who were so confident in their ability to spot fakes that they brushed aside X-rays and other modern tests, as well as collectors desperate for authenticity&#x2014;fuels the market for forgeries. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>Readers who stop short of this book's final section may dismiss it as a savvy marketer's creation: multicultural spirituality focusing on near-death experiences replete with angels and dazzling light. Furthermore, Berman's list of virtues includes self-actualization, ecological sensitivity and tolerance, while the roster of vices lists materialism, dogma and ecclesiastical authority. Berman, the award-winning author of The Search for Meaning and The Courage of Conviction, is without doubt a gifted communicator in the spiritual idiom of the 1990s; he has not, however, succumbed entirely to spirituality lite. From the book's premise that death teaches us how to live to its ethics-based conclusion that "when you love something,... responsibility quickly follows," Berman proclaims the goodness of creation without losing sight of the starker side of classical mysticism: sin, judgment, hell. The book's always fascinating and sometimes sensational stories are anchored by the last two chapters, in which Berman works out an "eternal theology" that ranks with the best of contemporary wisdom literature. (Dec.) Author tour.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Berman, an oral historian and author (Search for Meaning, Ballantine, 1993), believes there are common themes and insights into near-death experiences (NDEs) through which we can obtain a greater appreciation of life. His collection of interviews is less comprehensive than Near Death Experience: A Reader (Routledge, 1996), but it is more thorough in underscoring common themes in NDEs. Most NDEs relate the participant's need to become closer to his or her God, to gain knowledge; individuals do not lose a fear of dying but do lose a fear of death. The transformation in the individual after the incident demonstrates that he or she has had a glimpse of a profound spiritual vision. Berman includes in this collection Howard Storm, a former art professor, whose NDE was a trip to a dark place (hell); in his despair he called to God for assistance and moved to the bright light. Whatever the outcome, individuals feel self-transcendence, timelessness, ecstasy, and unity. A compelling study; recommended for public libraries.?L.

Young, handsome, expert horseman, crack pistol shot, his swaggering style irritated the stuffier of the king's courtiers almost as much as the 'Roundheads' they were fighting. To the parliamentarians, above all Oliver Cromwell, he was the ultimate 'malignant', one of those Royalists who fought on even after Charles was executed in 1649. Rupert commanded the Royalist forces in exile, at one point reduced to little more than pirates before the triumphant restoration of the monarchy in 1660.</p><p> In Charles Spencer's thoroughly researched account, Prince Rupert is revealed as more than just a great general and dashing cavalier. He was a scientist and classical scholar too: a true renaissance prince. From his dramatic childhood escape through the snows of Bohemia to respected older statesman, this is the first comprehensive biography of the greatest cavalier of them all.</p></p><p>Charles Spencer was educated at Eton College and obtained his degree in Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford. Since he was a boy the Battle of Blenheim has fascinated him - it was even his History O level special project - partly because of the Spencer-Churchill direct link to the engagement&#39;s prime victor, John, Duke of Marlborough. While in the middle of a seven year stint as a correspondent for NBC News in the United States, Charles Spencer inherited the ancestral home of Althorp, Northampton, which he has since restored and refurbished. He lives at Althorp and in West London with his wife, four children from his first marriage, and two stepsons. He achieved worldwide attention after speaking passionately at the funeral of his sister Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. His previous works are &#39;Althorp: the Story of an English House&#39; (1998) and &#39;The Spencer Family&#39; (1999).One of the most compelling historical characters to emerge from the English Civil War was Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who captured the imagination of his contemporaries as well as subsequent historians and laymen who have studied seventeenth-century Britain. Now Spencer turns in an interesting biography of this interesting man. Rupert was born in Prague, but he had strong ties to British royalty. He was the grandson of King James I and the great-grandson of Mary I, Queen of Scots. From an early age, Rupert showed both skill and enthusiasm for the military arts. At&nbsp;19, he fought in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War for the Protestant forces. At&nbsp;23, he&nbsp;was appointed by King Charles I to lead the royalist cavalry. His bold, occasionally reckless charges earned him the admiration of royalists&nbsp;and fear and hatred from parliamentarians. Yet, as Spencer illustrates, Rupert was not a one-dimensional man. He was also an inventor and a lover of classical literature. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Epic Collection Star Wars 1: The New Republic</h2><p>When the Empire falls, a New Republic rises!

Buckley during the presidential conventions of 1968, especially during the siege of Chicago.&nbsp; He had held his ground, driving Buckley mad with his relentless logic and unflappable manner.&nbsp; I had read half a dozen of his novels, including <i>Myra Breckinridge, Burr, </i>and<i> Lincoln. </i>Needless to say, I wanted to meet him.<br> I sent a brief note, telling Gore I was an American writer living at 23 via Torricelli in Atrani, and would like to meet him.&nbsp; That evening he pounded on my door, inviting us (my wife and I) to dinner.&nbsp; I was terrified, as his reputation preceded him, and thought he might be tricky. But a friendship blossomed. I would often meet him for a drink or dinner, and a series of conversations began that lasted until his death in 2012.&nbsp; It would be fair to say, in a crude way, that I was looking for a father, and he seemed in search of a son.&nbsp; We had a good deal&nbsp; in common, including a passion for liberal politics, American history, and books.&nbsp; We both loved Henry James, Twain, Trollope and Henry Adams &#x2013; just to name a few of the more obvious names &#x2013; and we invariably found we had more to talk about than time allowed.&nbsp; We also shared a love of both Italy and Britain.&nbsp; By that time I had spent seven years in the British Isles, and it turned out we knew many of the same people.&nbsp; The literary world is, in fact, quite small &#x2013; especially in Britain and Italy, where writers and editors often converge at parties and literary events.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br> In the decades that followed, we spoke on the phone every week &#x2013; for periods on a daily basis.&nbsp; And I would stay with him often in Ravello or, later, Los Angeles, meeting him often when he traveled.&nbsp; I have strong memories of times together in such places as Rome, Naples, Edinburgh, Oxford, London, New York, Boston, even Salzburg and Key West. He proved more than helpful to me as a younger writer, reading drafts of my books, offering frank critiques and encouragement.&nbsp; We discussed his work at length, too &#x2013; he would frequently send a typescript or galley for me to read.&nbsp; <br><br> His phone calls, in later years, often began:&nbsp; &#x201c;What are they saying about me?&#x201d;&nbsp; To a somewhat frightening degree, he depended on the world&#x2019;s opinion.&nbsp; Once, in one of those memories that stands in for many others, my wife and I were sitting in his study in Ravello when he came in with drinks.&nbsp; On the wall behind his desk were twenty or so framed magazine covers, with Gore&#x2019;s face on each cover.&nbsp; I asked:&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that all about, those covers?&#x201d;&nbsp; He said, &#x201c;When I come into this room in the morning to work, I like to be reminded who I am.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br> Over many decades he had built a huge empire of self, sending out colonies in various languages. &#x201c;They love me in Brazil,&#x201d; he would say.&nbsp; Or Bulgaria, or Turkey, or Hong Kong.&nbsp; I took his rampant egotism with a grain of salt.&nbsp; It was part of him, but only part.&nbsp; The narcissism was, at times, an exhausting and debilitating thing for him, as it proved impossible to get enough satisfying responses.&nbsp; He required a hall of mirrors for adequate reflection, and there was never enough. The narcissistic hole can&#x2019;t be filled.&nbsp; At times, I wondered about how much money and time I spent in winging off to various far-flung cities to spend a few days with him, and my transatlantic phone bills reflected my own mania.&nbsp; But his flame was very bright and warm, and I was drawn to it.</p><h2>Canal House Cooking Volume No. 5: The Good Life (Volume 5)</h2><p><i>Canal House Cooking Volume No. 5, The Good Life</i> is a collection of some of our favorite recipes, the ones we cook for ourselves, our friends, and our families during the fall and right through the holiday season.

With a strong narrative drive and unforgettable portraits of kings, queens, and soldiers, Barone takes an episode that has fallen into unjustified obscurity and restores it to the prominence it deserves.</p><p>MICHAEL BARONE is a senior writer with U.S. News &amp; World Report and a contributor to Fox News Channel. He is the principal coauthor of the biannual <i>Almanac of American Politics</i> and the author of <i>Our Country, The New Americans</i>, and <i>Hard America, Soft America</i>.Chapter 1<br>The Improbable Revolution<br><br>The First Revolution: what is generally known as the Glorious Revolution. In recent years Americans have been devouring books on our nation&#x2019;s Founding Fathers&#x2014;Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton&#x2014;some written by academic historians, others by gifted professional writers. As these writers help us understand, the Founders did not spring from a historical vacuum. Before the break with the Crown, they regarded themselves as Englishmen, as inheritors of the system of government and the traditional liberties of England. As they moved daringly into a revolutionary and republican future, they looked back on a heritage that was shaped by many historical events. Not least among them was what most Englishmen referred to as the Glorious Revolution of 1688&#x2013;89. This term referred to the series of events that resulted in the ouster of King James II and the installation of King William III and Queen Mary II, and in changes in English law, governance, and politics that turned out to be major advances for representative government, guaranteeing liberties, global capitalism, and a foreign policy of opposing hegemonic powers on the European continent and in the world beyond.<br><br>The First Revolution, as it will be called here, was a reference point, an example, indeed a glowing example, for the American Founders. The Founding Fathers began their rebellion not by rejecting the achievements of the Glorious Revolution, but by arguing that Parliament and King George III were denying them their rights as Englishmen that were gained in that Revolution and the revolutionary settlement&#x2014;the laws passed in 1689 and the 1690s. It is true that as the Founding Fathers created their own revolution and formed their republic, they did not fully accept the Revolutionary settlement&#x2014;the set of laws and customs established during and immediately following the Glorious Revolution. The new nation would have no monarchy or titled nobility, no religious tests for public office, and no national established church. But the founders also self-consciously copied some features of the Revolutionary settlement, from yearly sessions of Congress to the establishment of a national bank and a funded debt to the Second Amendment right to bear arms.<br><br>The Glorious Revolution has long been recognized in Britain as a founding event that has shaped the character of the nation ever since. But this First Revolution has gotten much less attention in the United States. For much of the second half of the twentieth century, academic historians in this country as well as in Britain have devoted much more attention to the events of 1641&#x2013;60, events that brought to the fore radicals who could be seen as ancestors of the Marxist revolutionaries of the twentieth century. The Glorious Revolution was seen, in contrast, as something in the nature of a coup d&#x2019;�tat brought off by royals and nobles, a shuffling of power between dead white males (never mind that important parts were played by Princesses Mary and Anne, Queen Mary Beatrice, and Sarah Churchill). But there is a strong argument that the events of 1641&#x2013;60 were less than consequential in shaping the English polity and what would become the American inheritance than was the Revolution of 1688&#x2013;89 and the Revolutionary settlement that was worked out in the 1690s. Those changes proved to be far more enduring.<br><br>The Revolution of 1688&#x2013;89 was the first change of government in England that was at the time called a revolution. Twentieth-century historians often refer to the events of 1641&#x2013;60 as the English Revolution,1 but this complicated series of events&#x2014;described by recent historians as three separate civil wars and a republican interregnum&#x2014;was not called a revolution in the seventeenth century.2 In contrast, the events of 1688&#x2013;89 were the first to be widely, almost universally, labeled a revolution by contemporaries.3<br><br>The First Revolution was a tremendously consequential event and a tremendously improbable one. &#x201c;I cannot forbear remarking,&#x201d; wrote the Cumberland landowner and regional political magnate Sir John Lowther in his Memoirs of the Reign of James II, &#x201c;how wonderfullie this thing succeeded in opposition to so many visible and apparent accidents, anie one of which whereof they had happened, the whole design must certainly have miscarried.&#x201d;4 It was, writes historian J. G. A. Pocock, an &#x201c;amazing and unpredicted transaction,&#x201d;5 or, as the historian Paul Rahe writes, it &#x201c;was by no means inevitable. It more nearly resembled a freak accident.&#x201d;6 William of Orange, stadholder of the Netherlands, assembled an army variously estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 men and a flotilla of five hundred ships, crossed the English Channel in the usually wind-tossed month of November, then pushed James II to order his army to retreat without a battle. Princess Mary, William&#x2019;s wife, and Princess Anne cooperated in the ouster of their father, James II. It was, as Pocock continues, &#x201c;a spectacular display of reason of state rising above the restraints of common morality; daughters dethroned their father, even the sanitized version of King Lear was hard to perform for many years, and what William of Orange and John Churchill severally did is still enough to take your breath away if you think about it.&#x201d;7 Or, as the Calvinist and usually humorless William said to the Anglican clergyman Gilbert Burnet after his troops successfully landed in England, &#x201c;Well, Doctor, what do you think of predestination now?&#x201d;8<br><br>The First Revolution happened in an England and a Europe very different from today&#x2019;s. This mostly bloodless revolution occurred after more than a century of religious wars. In England, Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church when denied a divorce, and in 1532 was declared the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Under Henry and his young successor Edward VI, the Church of England adopted many Protestant doctrines: the king was the Supreme Head of the Church, monasteries were closed, English translations of the Bible and an English Prayer Book were introduced.9 Edward died at 16 and was succeeded in 1553 by his older sister Mary I, who returned England to Catholicism and executed some 300 Protestants. She died in 1558 and her Protestant sister Elizabeth I reestablished the Church of England.<br><br>Despite the established Church of England, many forms of belief persisted under Elizabeth and her successor James I (1603&#x2013;25). There were Puritans, a loosely defined group who wanted to simplify Church ritual and belief, and Presbyterians, who believed that the Church should be governed by elders selected by congregations rather than by bishops selected by the king. There were, living secretly and also in the open, Catholics who remained loyal to the Church of Rome. Religious differences played an important role in the Civil War that broke out between Charles I and Parliament in 1642 and that resulted in the execution of the king in 1649. The parliamentary governments led by Oliver Cromwell and others banned Church of England clergy from preaching, ordered Catholic priests out of the kingdom, and stripped churches of ornament and paintings and broke stained-glass windows. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, the Church of England was again established. But in the years since Charles I was executed, there had grown up Dissenting Protestant sects that would in time be known as Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, and Quakers. The treatment of these Dissenting Protestants and of Catholics became lively political issues in Charles II&#x2019;s reign and that of his brother James II (1685&#x2013;88). 10<br><br>These religious struggles in England went on simultaneously but not in close connection with the struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism in continental Europe. Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the church at Wittenberg in 1517 and defended his doctrines at the Diet of Worms, summoned by the young Emperor Charles V in 1521. Lutheranism and other forms of Protestantism spread in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary through much of the sixteenth century. The Peace of Augsburg of 1555 was based on the principle of cuius regio eius religio: the ruler of each state would determine its religion. Protestantism seemed to prevail over about half of Christian Europe.<br><br>The Catholic Church responded to this Reformation with a Counter-Reformation. The Council of Trent, concluded in 1563, reaffirmed traditional Catholic doctrine and ordered internal reforms of the Church. Counter-Reformation Catholicism was characterized by a rigorous faith, elaborate ceremony with incense and inspiring music, beautifully decorated baroque churches to inspire awe and to make the Mass an emotionally moving experience. The baroque churches still found today from Rome to France and Germany, Bohemia and Poland, Spain and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies of Latin America are concrete evidence of the confidence and verve of the Counter-Reformation Catholic Church.<br><br>In different countries Catholics went on the offensive. In France, leading Protestant Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew&#x2019;s Day Massacre in 1572; after the Huguenot Henri IV became king in 1589, he faced civil war and converted to Catholicism, concluding, &#x201c;Paris is worth a Mass.&#x201d; In what is now Germany, the Catholic Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperors went on the offensive in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War (1618&#x2013;48), and Protestantism was extirpated in what are now the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and large parts of Germany. The treaties of Westphalia ended this conflict in 1648, recognizing the independence of states, including those within the Holy Roman Empire, and the right of their rulers to determine their religion. The United Provinces of the Netherlands, which had been fighting their Catholic Spanish overlords since 1568, were recognized as an independent Protestant nation, outside the empire. But the overall result of these religious wars was that by the late seventeenth century about two-thirds of the people of Christian Europe lived in Catholic domains and &#x201c;between 1590 and 1690 the geographical reach of Protestantism shrank from one-half to one-fifth of the land area of the continent.&#x201d;11 &#x201c;Every observer of the contemporary scene knew that effectively the principle of cuius regio eius religio operated,&#x201d; writes the historian K. H. D. Haley. &#x201c;No Catholic king ruled over a Protestant people.&#x201d;12<br><br>England and the United Provinces, the two states intimately involved in the First Revolution, were thus small Protestant outliers on the northwest fringes of a mostly Catholic continent. They were also exceptions to the trend in Europe toward stability imposed by absolutist governments.13 &#x201c;In 1590,&#x201d; writes Reformation historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, &#x201c;around half of the European land-mass was under the control of Protestant governments and/or Protestant culture: in 1690 the figure was only around a fifth.&#x201d;14 Christian Europe, that is Europe excluding the Ottoman Empire, which came up to the gates of Vienna in 1683, had about 100 million people at the time of the Glorious Revolution. England had about 5 million,15 its sister kingdoms Scotland and Ireland about 1 and 2 million respectively. Britain&#x2019;s North American colonies had about 250,000. London was the one huge city in the British Isles, with 375,000 people around 1650 and 490,000 around 1700, about 10 percent of England&#x2019;s population. The next largest town, Norwich, had only 30,000, and there were about 60 towns with populations between 2,500 and 11,000.16 The United Provinces of the Netherlands had 2 million people. In contrast, France was a demographic monster, with 20 million people, and there were about 18 million in the many states that now make up Germany. Spain, sapped by constant warfare and colonial overextension, had about 7.5 million and the Spanish Netherlands, approximately today&#x2019;s Belgium, another 1.5 million; Spain&#x2019;s Latin American colonies had approximately 10 million, while the English North American colonies had only 280,000.17<br><br>France was not only the most populous nation in Europe, but by many measures the richest. Amsterdam and London had trade ties to large parts of the world, and the United Provinces and England had large navies; France could not only afford a large navy, but fielded huge armies besides. Its rich farmlands produced every nontropical crop, and its state-protected industries produced unmatched luxury goods. In the 1650s France had been preoccupied by the civil war known as the Fronde. But that was over by 1661, when Cardinal Mazarin died and the 23-year-old Louis XIV began 54 years of personal rule. Louis soon embarked on military campaigns to expand his kingdom. He started major wars in each decade. His forces were led by able generals and by the King himself on occasion; his military engineers and fortifications were the best in Europe. The French army invaded the United Provinces in 1672 with 130,000 men, outnumbering the Dutch forces by four to one.18<br><br>Louis also sought to expand the realm of Catholicism. &#x201c;Louis spurred on the Duke of Savoy,&#x201d; writes MacCulloch, &#x201c;in his murderous campaign against his Protestant subjects: Louis overturned his grandfather&#x2019;s religious settlement for France by revoking the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Louis conquered largely Protestant lands of the Empire in Alsace, finally making a Catholic Strasbourg out of Martin Bucer&#x2019;s proud Strassburg, which long before had been the prime candidate to lead the Protestant world.&#x201d;19<br><br>Louis XIV&#x2019;s France, with its commitment to Catholicism and its trend toward absolutist government, seemed the wave of the future in the 1670s and 1680s. It was the largest nation-state and militarily the mightiest. Its king consolidated his power by setting aside institutions that traditionally limited royal power, like the Estates General, which did not meet from 1614 to 1789, and consigned the formerly powerful regional nobles to the ritualized court life of first the Louvre and then Versailles. Other rulers followed his example. In Bavaria and Brandenburg forceful rulers broke the power of the estates, as did the rulers of the Rhenish Palatinate and Baden. A similar process occurred in the domains of the Austrian Hapsburgs. Denmark and, a quarter-century later, Sweden developed absolutist government, while in Spain and Portugal the power of the legislative assemblies, the Cortes, was sharply curtailed.20 Many in the smaller German states feared the trend would prevail there.21 Republicanism was on the wane, alive in the bustling Netherlands and backward Switzerland, ailing in a declining Venice and extinct in most of the rest of Italy (with the conspicuous exception of the small city of Lucca), defunct after the Restoration in England. The forces resisting absolutism were those asserting ancient, arguably feudal, rights, and local particularity: the vestiges of the past. Absolutism, seemingly modern and efficient, seemed the way of the future.22<br><br>Yet in the long run absolutism did not prevail. Out of one corner of Europe, in the British Isles, an alternative emerged, constitutional monarchy with limits on government, guaranteed rights, relatively benign religious toleration, and free market global capitalism. After the Glorious Revolution the merchant class as well as the nobility successful cabined in the power of king and prince. The nobility did not totally dominate the life of society, and merchants and entrepreneurs were left free to trade and innovate.23 And here the key event was the First Revolution, in which the Protestant stadholder of the Netherlands supplanted the Catholic king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and ensured that those countries would continue on a course very different fr...</p><h2>Nerve: Poise Under Pressure, Serenity Under Stress, and the Brave New Science of Fear and Cool</h2><p>Nerves make us bomb job interviews, first dates, and SATs. With a presentation looming at work, fear robs us of sleep for days. It paralyzes seasoned concert musicians and freezes rookie cops in tight situations. And yet not everyone cracks. Soldiers keep their heads in combat; firemen rush into burning buildings; unflappable trauma doctors juggle patient after patient. It's not that these people feel no fear; often, in fact, they're riddled with it. <br><br>In <em>Nerve</em>, Taylor Clark draws upon cutting-edge science and painstaking reporting to explore the very heart of panic and poise. Using a wide range of case studies, Clark overturns the popular myths about anxiety and fear to explain why some people thrive under pressure, while others falter-and how we can go forward with steadier nerves and increased confidence.</p><p>Taylor Clark is a writer based in Portland, Oregon. A graduate of Dartmouth College and a Pacific Northwest native, he has written for <i>GQ</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>Psychology Today</i>, among other publications.Clark, author of Starbucked (2007), maintains his light, frequently humorous tone in this (mostly) serious look at the psychology of stress. Drawing on various forms of research, and numerous real-life stories, the author explores the reasons why we feel stress, our responses to it, and what we can do to deal with it constructively. Clark takes us through the history of stress research, from early breakthroughs (Walter Cannons 1915 elucidation of the fight-or-flight response) to experimental research (most of what we know about the science of fear comes from tormenting rats, Clark wryly observes) to todays cutting-edge explorations of the workings of the human brain. The subjects of his real-life stories of dealing with stress under intense pressure range from Russian sub commanders to game-show contestants to tsunami survivors to pro athletes to musicians. The author makes some shrewd observations (for example, that Cannons fight-or-flight response leaves out a third F: freeze), and, unlike many authors of popular-science books, he really knows how to write, too: the book is informative, engaging, and, in quite a few places, funny. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Assassination of Hole in the Day</h2><p><p>On June 27, 1868, Hole in the Day (Bagonegiizhig) the Younger left Crow Wing, Minnesota, for Washington, DC, to fight the planned removal of the Mississippi Ojibwe to a reservation at White Earth. Several miles from his home, the self-styled leader of all the Ojibwe was stopped by at least twelve Ojibwe men and fatally shot.</p><p>Hole in the Day&#x2019;s death was national news, and rumors of its cause were many: personal jealousy, retribution for his claiming to be head chief of the Ojibwe, retaliation for the attacks he fomented in 1862, or retribution for his attempts to keep mixed-blood Ojibwe off the White Earth Reservation. Still later, investigators found evidence of a more disturbing plot involving some of his closest colleagues: the business elite at Crow Wing.</p><p>While most historians concentrate on the Ojibwe relationship with whites to explain this story, Anton Treuer focuses on interactions with other tribes, the role of Ojibwe culture and tradition, and interviews with more than fifty elders to further explain the events leading up to the death of Hole in the Day. <i>The Assassination of Hole in the Day </i>is not only the biography of a powerful leader but an extraordinarily insightful analysis of a pivotal time in the history of the Ojibwe people.</p><p><br>&#x201c; An essential study of nineteenth-century Ojibwe leadership and an important contribution to the field of&nbsp; American Indian Studies by an author of extraordinary knowledge and talent. Treuer&#x2019;s work is infused with a powerful command over Ojibwe culture and linguistics.&#x201d;</p><p>--Ned Blackhawk, author of <i>Violence Over the Land: Indians and Empires in the&nbsp; Early American West</i></p><p><b>Anton Treuer</b>, professor of Ojibwe at Bemidji State University, is the author of <i>Ojibwe in Minnesota </i>and several books on the Ojibwe language. He is also the editor of <i>Oshkaabewis Native Journal</i>, the only academic journal of the Ojibwe language.</p></p><p>&#34;The Assassination of Hole in the Day is a masterful history, and more. Anton Treuer illuminates the character of a controversial and charismatic Ojibwe leader from within Ojibwe culture, and tells a powerful story of loss that reverberates in the present.&#34; Louise ErdrichTreuer, professor of Ojibwa culture and language, became intrigued as a youngster with the stories surrounding the mysterious assassination by his own people of Ojibwa leader Bagone-giizhig (Hole in the Day). Relying on primary sources and extensive oral histories, Treuer explores the life and death of this brash young leader, and delves into tribal history and the intricate machinations of Ojibwa politics. After his father&#x2019;s death in 1847, Hole in the Day the younger, at 19, inherited his father&#x2019;s role as leader of the Gull Lake Ojibwa, boldly asserting his dominance over older, respected chiefs. He negotiated with white traders, both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, and the staff at the Indian agency, always knowing exactly when to forge friendships, lie, threaten, cajole, bully, and back down in his dealings with whites, the Dakota, and his own people. But his pride and bold ways led to his death in 1868, as he was leaving for Washington to renegotiate the unpopular Treaty of 1867. Treuer skillfully untangles some of the many threads leading to his untimely demise. --Deborah Donovan</p><h2>The Future of Violence: Robots and Germs, Hackers and Drones-Confronting A New Age of Threat</h2><p><b>Two legal scholars explore the security and political implications of revolutionary new technologies from drones to 3-D printers, and explain how governments must adapt to our brave new world of dispersed threats.</b><br>From drone warfare in the Middle East to digital spying by the National Security Agency, the U.S. government has harnessed the power of cutting-edge technology to awesome effect. But what happens when ordinary people have the same tools at their fingertips? Advances in cybertechnology, biotechnology, and robotics mean that more people than ever before have access to potentially dangerous technologies-from drones to computer networks and biological agents-which could be used to attack states and private citizens alike.<br>In <i>The Future of Violence</i>, law and security experts Benjamin Wittes and Gabriella Blum detail the myriad possibilities, challenges, and enormous risks present in the modern world, and argue that if our national governments can no longer adequately protect us from harm, they will lose their legitimacy. Consequently, governments, companies, and citizens must rethink their security efforts to protect lives and liberty. In this brave new world where many little brothers are as menacing as any Big Brother, safeguarding our liberty and privacy may require strong domestic and international surveillance and regulatory controls. Maintaining security in this world where anyone can attack anyone requires a global perspective, with more multinational forces and greater action to protect (and protect against) weaker states who do not yet have the capability to police their own people. Drawing on political thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to the Founders and beyond, Wittes and Blum show that, despite recent protestations to the contrary, security and liberty are mutually supportive, and that we must embrace one to ensure the other. <br><br><i>The Future of Violence</i> is at once an introduction to our emerging world--one in which students can print guns with 3-D printers and scientists' manipulations of viruses can be recreated and unleashed by ordinary people--and an authoritative blueprint for how government must adapt in order to survive and protect us.<br><br></p><p><b>Benjamin Wittes</b> is a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and the editor-in-chief of <i>Lawfare</i>.

He also uncovers the ways in which resorts are carefully engineered to separate visitors from their money, much like theme parks.<br>Clifford suggests an alternative to this bleak picture in the return-to-the-roots movement that is now beginning to find its voice in American ski towns from Mammoth Lakes, California, to Stowe, Vermont.

From a humble family background, she joined the Cuban revolutionary underground movement as a young teacher in Santa Clara, central Cuba. She met Che during the revolutionary war and they married in June 1959. She now lives with their four children and numerous grandchildren in Havana.March was Guevara&#x2019;s second wife and the mother of four of his five children. After four decades of chosen silence, she reveals in her memoir many interesting and sometimes surprising aspects of her life and her life with Guevara. She was raised in a rural section of Las Villas province, and she aspired to become a teacher. Like many youthful and idealistic Cubans, she despised the Batista dictatorship, so joining the July 26th underground resistance seemed a moral imperative. Her account of her activities, primarily gathering and conveying information, is harrowing and inspiring. Her meeting with Guevara and the flowering of their relationship are recounted with emotion, but she avoids excessive sentimentality. March understandably ignores some of Guevara&#x2019;s unpleasant traits, including his ideological rigidity and his intolerance for the failures of others. Still, the inclusion of previously unpublished letters to her show a seldom-seen side, as he seems capable of deep personal attachment as well as longings for the domestic life he has sacrificed. This is the informative and poignant story of a rather modest woman thrust into the center of some important historical events. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>No Man Alone: A Neurosurgeon&#39;s Life</h2><p>The pioneering and creative brain surgeon recounts the course of his eventful life and career, detailing the drama and tensions of his endeavors, discoveries, and breakthroughs in neurology, neurophysiology, and neurosurgery</p><p></p><h2>The Big Book of Near-Death Experiences: The Ultimate Guide to What Happens When We Die</h2><p><p><i>The Big Book of Near-Death Experiences</i> encompasses every aspect of the near-death phenomenon: the experience, aftereffects, and implications.

It was an order the young lieutenant protested vehemently, but the commanders at the Tactical Command Center disregarded his objections. Uthlaut split his platoon into two serials, with serial one traveling northwest to Manah and serial two towing a broken Humvee north toward the Khost highway. By nightfall, Uthlaut and his radio operator were seriously wounded, and an Afghan militia soldier and a U.S. soldier were dead. The American soldier was my son, Pat Tillman.<br> The Tillman family was originally informed that Pat, who had given up a professional football career to serve his country, had been shot in the head while getting out of a vehicle. At his memorial service twelve days later, they were told that he was killed while running up a hill in pursuit of the enemy. He was awarded a Silver Star for his courageous actions. A month and two days after his death, the family learned that Pat had been shot three times in the head by his own troops in a "friendly fire" incident. Seven months after Pat's death, the Tillmans requested an investigation. <br><i>Boots on the Ground by Dusk</i> is a chronicle of their efforts to ascertain the true circumstances of Pat's death and the reasons why the Army gave the family and the public a false story. Woven into the account are valuable and respectful memories of Pat Tillman as a son, brother, husband, friend, and teammate, in the hope that the reader will better comprehend what is really lost when our sons and daughters are killed or maimed in war. <br>In the course of three and a half years, there have been six investigations, several inquiries, and two Congressional hearings.

BEARD<br><br>A chilly breeze rustles the leaves of an old elm, whose branches hang over me like a canopy. The sound of crackling and sizzling oak logs is all I hear as I sit wrapped in a quilt staring into the fire pit in my front yard. One log splinters and falls onto another. There is a snap and a swish as tiny yellow and red sparks scatter into the darkness, as if to join the flickering stars in the distance. I light my cigarette wondering what I would do if I couldn't smoke, if I couldn't blow out my anger, frustration, and sense of crippling loss into the night.<br><br>In forty-eight years I have never been a smoker, but now I am smoking to stay sane. Pulling the quilt around my shoulders, I wonder how it can be so cold tonight, when just weeks earlier I sat sweltering in a pink linen dress at my son's memorial service. It was important to me that I not wear black on that day. I wanted to wear something cheerful in celebration of his life and his spirit. However, as I sat in the intense heat listening to the whine of bagpipes, perspiration seeping through the light fabric, I felt vulnerable, exposed, as though people could see the pain of my loss through my sweat-soaked dress.<br><br>Ashes from my cigarette fall onto the quilt. I toss the butt into the fire and look around at what I can see of my yard from the light of the flames. In the two weeks following my son's death, this yard had been almost constantly full of people. I remember the movement of bodies and drone of voices, but I only recall a few specific faces, and I remember almost nothing of what was said. Now the yard is empty. My family members have returned to their homes to face their own void, and our friends have gone back to lives they neglected in order to support us and to deal with the shock over the death of their friend. I feel alone and frightened, wondering how I am going to live my life without my oldest son.<br><br>The fog is rolling in, obscuring the stars in the distance. I get up to place another log on the fire and stare into the blaze. My thoughts drift to another time, and I turn to look up at the elm tree behind me. My eye catches a six-inch stub, a remnant from a branch removed long ago, protruding twelve feet from the base of the sturdy trunk. A painful lump forms in my throat, and my sinuses sting as I try to hold back tears. But as my brain conjures the memory that my emotions fear to confront, a smile forms on my face, gently releasing the welling tears down my cheeks.<br><br>I see my son at nineteen, standing muscled and tan on the front stoop of our house, smiling devilishly, first at me, and then in the direction of the elm twenty feet away. I watch his smile slowly fade as his eyes stare intently at something I cannot see. Suddenly, he pushes off from the stoop and takes a running leap at the tree, planting his right foot about five feet up the trunk. His momentum propels him to grab the stub jutting at least five feet above his head and to swing himself with one solid tug onto an adjacent branch. He stands up with his arms raised and smiles down on me as if to say, "Life is great!" And then we both laugh.<br><br>It was under the umbrella of this big elm that my son played as a child. The house that stands before me, that holds so many memories, is where we lived when he was born. Patrick Daniel Tillman was full of life from the moment he came into the world at 9:39 on the morning of November 6, 1976, occipito-posterior, facing up--a stargazer.<br><br>He was brought home to this house, which is nestled in the rocky and wooded canyon of New Almaden, a California settlement developed in 1845 after a rich supply of quicksilver (mercury) was discovered there. Quicksilver was once a necessary component in processing gold and silver as well as in manufacturing munitions, which led President Lincoln to seize the mines in 1863, for the duration of the Civil War.<br><br>From the time I was ten years old, the Civil War has fascinated me; learning that New Almaden had in fact played a crucial role in that war made me feel we had moved to the perfect place. The mines operated under private ownership until the year Pat was born, when Santa Clara County purchased the surrounding property for a county park. These four thousand acres, with their twenty miles of beautiful and rugged trails, is where I would take Pat for walks as a baby.<br><br>He was not a cuddly infant. Actually, he was a little malcontent. He didn't like being swaddled and held like most babies; he preferred to be upright. I remember I would sit in a chair and hold him up so he could bounce on my knees until my arms got so tired I could no longer hold him. As an infant Pat was quite sinewy, displaying his father's quick-twitch muscles and the incredible coordination of his uncle Rich. When he was three months old, his father and I got a back carrier for him. He was really too little to sit in it properly, so I'd stuff diapers all around him so he would fit snugly. It was from the back carrier that Pat got his first exposure to Quicksilver County Park.<br><br>We would hike for hours while I described the sights. Along with the birds and squirrels, it was not unusual to see wild turkeys, families of quail, wild boar, or an occasional rattlesnake. On weekends, Pat's father and I also liked to take him on walks past the reservoir two miles up the road. We loved living in this quaint secluded place, but my husband's hour-long commute to Cupertino, where he worked, was grueling. So when Pat was seven months old, we moved to Campbell, California, where our second son, Kevin, was born.<br><br>About six months before Kevin's arrival, Pat went through a phase of regularly hurling himself out of his crib and onto the floor in protest of bedtime. He would crawl over to the bedroom door, put his hand through the crack underneath it, and howl, "O-o-o-u-t! O-o-o-u-t!" You could see the little pink balls of his fingers desperately seeking someone's attention. I would sit on the couch with a lump in my throat and tears rolling down my face. My pediatrician had told me I needed to let him cry, and eventually he would stop, and as a young mom, I still thought my doctor knew best. When Pat's crying stopped, his father and I would gently open the door to find him asleep, knees curled under him, diapered bottom in the air, and his hand still reaching through the space under the door. We would carefully lift him and place him back in the crib. After a week of this gut- wrenching ritual, we decided to get Pat a big-boy bed with a railing on it.<br><br>Pat never really crawled in the way babies do. To get around, he would hold a plastic doughnut in each hand and push them around the floor with his legs straight, butt in the air, and knees never touching the floor. He learned to walk when he was eight and a half months old.<br><br>By the time Kevin was born on January 24, 1978, fourteen-month-old Pat seemed very much a little man. Now the crib that had been so repellent to him just months before became a curiosity; it held his baby brother. Pat began climbing into the crib and carefully curling up next to Kevin, as if he had an innate sense that he could hurt the baby if he rolled over. Pat was quite pleased to have Kevin in his world and liked to help me bathe, feed, and change him. Pat did not like to nap; he hated the idea that he might miss something, but some days I needed him to take a nap, so I would sit on the floor, with Kevin in the infant seat next to me, and read aloud as Pat played. Eventually, Pat would sidle up and sit between his brother and me. Often he fell asleep holding Kevin's hand.<br><br>Pat was talking all the time by twenty-two months. If you asked him his name, he would say, "Packet Daniel Tillman." He pronounced Kevin "Nubbin." As months passed, Pat learned to pronounce his own name properly, but he continued to call Kevin Nubbin or Nub. To this day, everyone close to Kevin calls him Nub.<br><br>We had a nice little front yard at the triplex. My husband and I had put in a new lawn six months before Kevin was born, so the grass was thick and green. But I was nervous about the boys playing in the front yard close to the street, so I usually had them play in the back, where there was a tiny patch of grass alongside the cement parking area.<br><br>My mother, Victoria Spalding, who lived twenty miles away in Fremont, often came to visit us when she wasn't working. One morning she and I took the boys to the PruneYard, an outdoor shopping mall ten minutes from our house. My youngest brother, Mike, who was around eighteen at the time, was going to come to visit in the afternoon. Time got away from us, and I was worried we wouldn't get home in time for my brother's arrival. I told the boys, "We have to hurry. Uncle Mike is coming. We don't want him to have to wait for us." I strapped Pat and Kevin into their car seats and we headed home. Pat, not wanting to keep his uncle waiting, kept saying, "Hurwe, Mom! Hurwe!" As we turned the corner onto our street, Pat unbuckled his seat belt, scrambled out of his car seat, and planted himself behind the front seats, poking his head between my mom and me. When he saw his uncle's Volkswagen parked in our driveway, his face looked grave. Concerned that his uncle had been waiting, he yelled at the top of his lungs, "Here we come, Unka Mike!"<br><br>Pat was always unbuckling his car seat. In the late seventies, the car seats were easy to buckle and unbuckle. It was constant worry and aggravation. I would be driving down the freeway, glimpse in the rearview mirror, and see Pat out of his seat. I'd turn around to find him unhooking Kevin and helping him out. Both of them would start to giggle and squat behind the seats, covering their heads with their blankets. I'd have to pull over, put them back in their seats, and scold them. We would then head off down the road. Within ten minutes, Pat would be out of his seat and letting his brother loose again. It didn't matter how annoyed I got; they both seemed to think the routine was a hoot. I can't recall when this little antic stopped, but I was grateful when it did.<br><br>Just before Kevin turned a year old, we moved to another location in Campbell, where we rented a white elephant of a two-story house. The beauty of it was that it had a fairly good-sized backyard. My husband hung two ropes from some beams that at one time had supported a patio roof. The boys would wear Spider-Man Underoos with Superman capes and swing from one side of the patio to the other, clearing their world of bad guys. By the time Pat was two and a half, he could hold on to both ropes and swing into a back flip. Kevin, at fourteen months, would hold on to both ropes, lift his feet in the air, and wait for his own flip to happen. He wouldn't put his feet down until his brother clapped in approval.<br><br>At this stage, the boys looked very much alike. Strangers would often mistake them for twins. They both had blond hair with the same bowl cut. Firm, chubby cheeks padded faces of similar structure. Their skin was naturally a creamy pink, but a day or two in the sun turned them brown like berries and streaked their brown eyebrows with golden strands. The difference in their faces was in the eyes. When serious, Pat's deep, dark, almond-shaped eyes had an intensity and earnestness that could be startling as well as unsettling. When he laughed, they turned into horizontal black crescents that twinkled and teased playfully. Kevin had enormous blue eyes surrounded by feathery black lashes that made him look curious and surprised at the same time. For several years, I called Kevin my Tweety Bird. Within six months or so, Pat's jaw became much more angular, and once again, it was clear he was the older brother.<br><br>Several months before Pat turned three, on a very windy day, he and Kevin were upstairs playing while my mom and I baked cookies in the kitchen below. At about the same moment, we looked at each other, thinking the same thing: "The boys are too quiet!" As I rounded a corner to head up the stairs, there was a knock on our front door. It was my neighbor from across the street. She told me Pat had climbed out the second-story window onto the roof of the porch.<br><br>I bolted upstairs, questions racing through my mind: How had Pat unlocked a window I could barely open myself? Had I forgotten to lock it? I ran into the room and found Kevin on his tiptoes, peering outside, watching his brother. I gathered myself, my heart racing, walked to Kevin, picked him up, and handed him to my mom, who was now behind me. Kneeling down, I stuck my head outside to discover Pat had leaped from the roof to a tall, thin tree that grew about three feet from the house. He had his arms wrapped around the trunk and yelled with joy, "Here it comes!" as the wind blew the tree back and forth.</p><h2>The Evolution of Claire (Jurassic World)</h2><p><b>Don't miss this pulse-pounding prequel to the <i>Jurassic World</i> movies that reveals the never-before-seen backstory of beloved film character Claire Dearing.</b><br><br>Freshman year in college is full of obstacles--there are messy roommates, cranky professors, and disgusting dining halls.

His beautiful illustrations capture the wild, seductive power of this classic book. This newly designed edition will be enjoyed by fans young and old alike.</p></p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

But I knows me rats, sir. If the h'Oriental chap says that's wot 'appened, then I'll back 'im h'all the way." Kids, of course, figure prominently in each story, too--whether as protagonists or as more scurrilous lads and lasses getting their well-deserved comeuppance. One such schoolboy causes much mayhem in the book's first (and by far best) story, in which an aspiring scoundrel named Archibald Smifft summons an occult creature, the Ribbajack, to do his evil bidding. Other stories riff off various other creepy creatures, from werewolves to ghosts to even Medusa, usually with some winking moral woven in by Jacques.</p><p> </p><p> Some of the tales (the title story and "Miggy Mags and the Malabar Sailor," in particular) pack more punch than others, but there's more than enough fun here for a few late-night, flashlight reads. <i>(Ages 9 to 12) --Paul Hughes</i></p>Grade 5-8-Jacques offers six original ghost stories to follow up on Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales (Putnam, 1991). The title story is more grotesque than scary, and the ghost in "A Smile and a Wave" is inexplicably evil, existing only to scare the main character into wearing her detested coat. The most satisfying selections are "Miggy Mags and the Malabar Sailor," in which a mongoose champions a young girl against her abusive uncle, and "Rosie's Pet," a preadolescent werewolf love story. The heavy northern English dialect used in the tellings would work well in an audio book, but may deter some readers. While this is an acceptable addition to general collections, true fans of the scary and strange will find more satisfaction in the short-story collections by Australian writer Paul Jennings, such as Unreal!

The son of poor Lebanese immigrants, the entertainer was born in 1914 on a horse farm in Michigan and grew up among Jewish, Irish, Italian and other new Americans, an ethnic mix that provides the material for the comic's storytelling routines. After breaking into radio in his youth, Thomas rose to fame in films and TV, remained married to his wife of 54 years, Rose Marie. He attributes his successful life to a kept promise to St. Jude to found and support a children's hospital in his name, an institution for which Thomas was awarded the Congressional Medal. The hospital, according to the star, is his greatest reward, outweighing his professional achievements, even his record-setting TV show, an 11-year prime-time favorite, Make Room for Daddy. Father to Tony, a noted TV producer, and actress-producer Marlo, Thomas also reports proudly on their careers. Among other attractions in the book are tender and funny tales of cherished friends Milton Berle, Lucille Ball, Sinatra, Sammy Davis and others.

Never before in American history had so many financial titans been called to account before the public, and they had come within a few weeks of emerging unscathed. By the time Ferdinand Pecora, a Sicilian immigrant and former New York prosecutor, took over as chief counsel, the investigation had dragged on ineffectively for nearly a year and was universally written off as dead. <br><br> <i>The Hellhound of Wall Street</i> provides a minute-by-minute account of the ten dramatic days when Pecora turned the hearings around, cross- examining the officers of National City Bank (today's Citigroup), particularly its chairman, Charles Mitchell, one of the best known bankers of his day. Mitchell strode into the hearing room in obvious disdain for the proceedings, but he left utterly disgraced. Pecora's rigorous questioning revealed that City Bank was guilty of shocking financial abuses, from selling worthless bonds to manipulating its stock price. Most offensive of all was the excessive compensation and bonuses awarded to its executives for peddling shoddy securities to the American public. <br><br> Pecora became an unlikely hero to a beleaguered nation. The man whom the press called "the hellhound of Wall Street" was the son of a struggling factory worker. Precocious and determined, he became one of New York's few Italian American lawyers at a time when Italians were frequently stereotyped as anarchic criminals. The image of an immigrant lawyer challenging a blue-blooded Wall Street tycoon was just one more sign that a fundamental shift was taking place in America. <br><br> By creating the sensational headlines needed to galvanize public opinion for reform, the Pecora hearings spurred Congress to take unprecedented steps to rein in the freewheeling banking industry and led directly to the New Deal's landmark economic reforms. A gripping courtroom drama with remarkable contemporary relevance, <i>The Hellhound of Wall Street</i> brings to life a crucial turning point in American financial history.</p><p>"Absolutely riveting! Michael Perino's account of the 1933 Pecora hearings, the sensational revelations of shady business practices at the highest levels on Wall Street, is a page-turner. No one can read about the many excesses of Wall Street in the 1920s without being struck&nbsp;by the similarities to today and wondering why we have allowed history to repeat itself."<br>--Liaquat Ahamed, author of <i>Lords of Finance</i> (winner of the Pulitzer Prize)<br><br>"Hats off to Michael Perino. <i>The Hellhound of Wall Street</i> is an excellent account of the Pecora hearings that should be read by everyone interested in financial reform. At the same time, it is a penetrating Wall Street morality tale that should evoke a strong sense of d�j� vu in its readers."<br>--Charles Geisst, author of <i>Collateral Damaged</i> and <i>Wall Street: A History</i><br><br>"<i>The Hellhound of Wall Street</i> is an incisive and timely book about a man and period in our country's history when a presumptuous, reckless Wall Street elite, very much like the one that's caused such ruin today, met its match.&nbsp; We badly need a second Ferdinand Pecora now.&nbsp; Michael Perino provides brilliant analysis and&nbsp;telling anecdotal material, and wears his deep erudition easily.&nbsp; He has given us a vital cautionary tale from the past that is a pure pleasure to read."<br>--Steve Fraser, author of <i>Every Man a Speculator</i><br><br>"It has taken another economic melt-down to restore public recognition of Ferdinand Pecora as the most effective investigator of financial wrongdoing in American history. Michael Perino deftly recreates the dark days of 1933, when that shrewd New York prosecutor turned Senate committee counsel forced Wall Street's biggest bankers and brokers to admit how they contributed to the nation's slide into the Great Depression."<br>--Donald A. Ritchie, author of <i>The U.S. Congress: A Very Short Introduction</i><br><br>"Michael Perino's new book powerfully amplifies our understanding of the pivotal role that Ferdinand Pecora played in leading the hearings that built the case for the New Deal's securities and banking laws. The <i>Hellhound of Wall Street</i> is a masterly evocation of the politics, finance and personalities when Congress last addressed systematic reform of our financial system."<br>--Joel Seligman, author of <i>The Transformation of Wall Street</i><b>Michael Perino</b> is the Dean George W.

You don&#x2019;t have to be an expert in the subject of online behavior to have observed that something about cyberspace provokes people to be more adventurous.<br><br>The illusion is that the cyber environment is safer than real life&#x2014;�and connecting with other people online somehow carries fewer risks than face-�to-�face contact. But our instincts were trained and honed for the real world, and in the absence of real-�world cues and other subtle pieces of information&#x2014;�facial expressions, body language, physical spaces&#x2014;�we aren&#x2019;t able to make fully informed decisions. And because we aren&#x2019;t face-�to-�face when we are communicating and interacting with others online, we can be anonymous or, more important, we feel we are. As discussed in the prologue to this book, we can feel freed up and emboldened online. People can lose their inhibitions and in a way &#x201c;act drunk&#x201d; because, for some, being in the cyber environment can impair judgment and increase impulsivity, somewhat similar to the way alcohol can. Disinhibition is facilitated by the environmental conditions of cyberspace&#x2014;�by the perceived lack of authority, the anonymity, as well as the sense of distance or physical remove.<br><br>You see this in the changing courtship rituals of self-�curated selfies and sexts, and in flirtatious exchanges on social-�networking sites. Online, we feel more comfortable being bold and explicit. An individual may demonstrate common sense, rationality, and restraint in real life and check these qualities at the door when entering cyberspace. Why?<br><br>In cyberpsychology, the explanation for this emboldened behavior is known as the online disinhibition effect, first introduced by John Suler and now highly cited and accepted by academics in the field. Another powerful factor comes into play, which I have studied and written about, online escalation. It is a construct or concept that I use to describe how problem behaviors become bigger&#x2014;�or amplified&#x2014;�online, as many of us have already witnessed in everything from supernegative exchanges via flaming emails, aggressive texts, and offensive posts to comment threads that are meant to provoke.<br><br>It isn&#x2019;t that technology is bad for us&#x2014;�or inherently negative. Problems occur when we are ignorant of its impact. Most people don&#x2019;t understand the effect that the environment of cyberspace can have on them. They think it&#x2019;s the same as anywhere else. Individuals who behave impulsively, or struggle with a tendency to act rashly, may be especially vulnerable. But due to the effect of online escalation, anyone can move more quickly into new behavior and new norms.<br><br>Later on, in a chapter about cyber romance, I will discuss the new ways people meet, make friends, form communities, and find meaningful personal connections online. In this chapter, though, I&#x2019;ll be exploring the impact of technology on a smaller slice of the population, specifically individuals with a fetish or paraphilia&#x2014;�what is considered atypical sexual behavior. Why bother looking so closely at one specific population online? By studying the extreme effects of technology on fringe or unusual behavior, we begin to see more clearly the implications of the cyber environment for all of us. As a forensic cyberpsychologist, I&#x2019;ve seen this demonstrated time and again: Whenever technology comes in contact with an underlying predisposition, or tendency for a certain behavior, it can result in behavioral amplification or escalation.<br><br>I would argue that tendencies and vulnerabilities that cause the most distress in real life may become even more of a battle online. That goes for any behavior.<br><br>If these tendencies aren&#x2019;t destructive or risky, the impact can be fairly benign. If someone just loves to visit online forums for gardeners, there isn&#x2019;t much that&#x2019;s self-�destructive about that. But there are many incidences of risky behavior becoming much riskier online, especially pathological and criminal behavior. Here&#x2019;s an example of what I mean: A stalker in the real world typically focuses on one victim at any given time, but a cyberstalker can stalk multiple victims simultaneously because technology makes that possible. Cyberstalking is considered an evolution of a real-�world criminal behavior. Cyberspace is a breeding ground for mutations. Real-�world behavior migrates there and escalates or accelerates. This can sometimes have serious implications in the real world.<br><br>A Case of Cranking<br><br>Jordan Haskins had grand dreams of making a difference in sparsely populated Saginaw County, Michigan, his hometown. The pale, clean-�cut twenty-�three-�year-�old man described himself as &#x201c;pro-�life, pro-�family, pro-�freedom, and pro-�faith.&#x201d; In the summer of 2014, while still a student at Maranatha Baptist University, he announced he was running for political office, hoping to serve as a state representative to Michigan&#x2019;s 95th District. He posed for his campaign website photograph with the best smile he could muster, his image superimposed on a background of a billowing American flag, a sepia-�toned Declaration of Independence, and artwork that appeared to be the three crosses of Calvary, synonymous with crucifixion, in dark outline.<br><br>The Republican candidate said his love of history, philosophy, religion, and politics had led him to run for office&#x2014;�and give back to society. He&#x2019;d realized that his gift was for government.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found my niche,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;my passion.&#x201d;<br><br>He had other passions, as it turns out. Before his campaign was fully under way, he found himself needing to explain his criminal record. He had been charged and pleaded guilty to four violations of trespassing on private and public property and unlawful use of government vehicles during a period of ten months in 2010 and 2011.<br><br>When interrogated by police at the time of his arrest, Haskins admitted that he had twice broken into a government yard where a mosquito-�control pickup truck and sheriff&#x2019;s cruiser were parked in order to pull the spark-�plug wires loose on the vehicles, sit in the front seat of the cars, and masturbate while listening to the engines sparking.<br><br>This behavior is called &#x201c;cranking,&#x201d; he explained to police. He was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison in 2011. Parole was lifted just eleven days prior to the election. &#x201c;I was in a messed-�up state of mind mentally and emotionally when I did what I did,&#x201d; the candidate told the local media when asked in 2014 about his felony convictions. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only way I can even explain it.&#x201d;<br><br>Cranking? What on earth possessed him to jump the fence into the police department parking lot, break into a car, and the rest . . . <br><br>&#x201c;It was just the fun and the risk and the thrill,&#x201d; Haskins said.<br><br>And how had he discovered this bizarre fetishistic behavior?<br><br>&#x201c;I read about it online.&#x201d;<br><br>Anatomy of a Fetish<br><br>At the back of New Age shops and hippie stores, next to the incense and patchouli oil, you&#x2019;ll find shelves of little carvings for sale. Inspired by the practices of Native American animism and West African religious cults, these small charms in the shape of animals are believed to be imbued with supernatural powers, carrying energy, communications from the spirit world&#x2014;�or simply good luck. Each of these objects is called a &#x201c;fetish.&#x201d;<br><br>The use of the word fetish for an object that causes sexual arousal is attributed to French psychologist Alfred Binet, who is best known for devising the earliest intelligence tests. In common usage, a fetish describes a strong compulsion or desire for a particular condition or activity. A woman might say, lightheartedly, &#x201c;I have a shoe fetish,&#x201d; meaning to suggest that she spends a disproportionate amount of her income on footwear. A man might say that stiletto heels excite him. In fact, feet and objects associated with feet are the most common fetishes. In psychology, fetishistic disorder is a mental health condition centering on the use of inanimate objects as a source of sexual satisfaction. <br><br>What causes one to develop a fetish in the first place? Sigmund Freud argued in his famous 1927 essay on fetishism that sexual fetishes were the result of arrested psychosexual development. Freud wrote: &#x201c;When now I announce that the fetish is a substitute for the penis, I shall certainly create disappointment; so I hasten to add that it is not a substitute for any chance penis, but for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Interestingly, Freud believed that the predominance of foot and shoe fetishes could be explained by a child&#x2019;s early memories of being on the floor and peering up a woman&#x2019;s skirt.<br><br>Freud&#x2019;s views and theories have many critics. Numerous contemporary psychologists are skeptical of his therapeutic approach, psychoanalysis, and have distanced themselves from it. I happen to value the work of Freud because it often helps to illuminate complex behavioral issues, and these days psychoanalytic theory has also advanced well beyond Freud&#x2019;s ideas. More contemporary psychoanalytic approaches have different explanations for fetishes, and describe how they can become a way for individuals to maintain a cohesive sense of self. But in general, other schools within psychology now hold sway, from Jean Piaget&#x2019;s theory of cognitive development to Erik Erikson&#x2019;s theory of psychosocial development. Currently there&#x2019;s enormous interest in biopsychology, and how the brain and neurotransmitters influence our behavior.<br><br>I suspect if he were alive today, Freud would be keenly interested in the impact of technology on humankind. Since he argued that sexual impulses were at the root of most behavior, I&#x2019;m sure he would identify sexual impulses as a contributor to some cyberbehavior.<br><br>Is sex behind all obscure behavior? Even Freud himself supposedly once said, &#x201c;Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.&#x201d;<br><br>Childhood experiences, though, do seem to explain some fetishes. As psychologist Robert Crooks and sex therapist Karla Baur write in their academic textbook, Our Sexuality, a boy may associate arousal with objects that belong to an emotionally significant person. The process of this association is sometimes referred to as symbolic transformation, when the object of the fetish becomes imaginatively endowed with the power or essence of its owner. In contemporary psychoanalysis the fetish is a self object, or an object that represents a significant other&#x2014;�usually a parent.<br><br>Some experts argue that fetishistic behavior has similarities with obsessive-�compulsive disorder. And like OCD, once ingrained, a fetish is an urge that is difficult to deny&#x2014;�a behavior that is very hard to resist. The conditioning process is commonly thought by modern psychologists to reinforce the fetish. Like Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov&#x2019;s famous dogs that salivated whenever they saw Pavlov&#x2019;s lab assistant, because they anticipated being fed, there is an anticipation of a reward when seeing the fetish object or thinking about the fetish behavior. In Haskins&#x2019;s cranking case, he had prior arrests as a juvenile for breaking into cars and joyriding, and perhaps these were thrilling adventures that he continually wanted to relive. Each time he broke into a car, his behavior was rewarded&#x2014;�reinforcing and strengthening the fetish. The more he took risks to do a little cranking, the more ingrained the behavior became. This is how conditioning works.<br><br>The growing number of websites catering to sexual fetishes involving cars (including pedalsupreme.com, which offers &#x201c;pedal pumping, engine cranking, leg and foot videos and pictures&#x201d;) is a sign that this is an escalating trend. There is also a YouTube channel, pumpthatpedaldotcom, which offers a new installment every week. According to sexologist Dr. Susan Block, one possible psychological explanation for this behavior is that the &#x201c; &#x2018;vroom&#x2019; of the engine reminds them of their own libidos being revved up.&#x201d;<br><br>A fetish can be created in a lab. In one classical conditioning experiment a group of male subjects in a laboratory were repeatedly shown erotic slides of nude women. Occasionally, an image of women&#x2019;s boots would appear in the slideshow. Soon the men had a sexual response to the photograph of boots alone, and over time they responded to images of other types of women&#x2019;s shoes. If a photograph of a pair of women&#x2019;s boots could be used so easily to condition desire, imagine how the Internet with its infinite supply of images could inspire, instill, and sustain a fetish.<br><br>That brings us back to Jordan Haskins, who lost the election for the 95th District after he&#x2019;d become a viral story&#x2014;�and the subject of unkind scrutiny and fascination. &#x201c;You may not respect my policies, you may not respect my ideas, but you at least have to respect me as a person,&#x201d; Haskins said. But I don&#x2019;t think too many people did.<br><br>Politicians + Paraphilia<br><br>Unusual sexual behaviors were once labeled &#x201c;deviant&#x201d; or &#x201c;perverted,&#x201d; even in clinical references. More recently, a less charged, less judgmental umbrella term, paraphilia, was adopted to describe a range of atypical behaviors that include fetishes. Paraphilia means &#x201c;beyond usual or typical love.&#x201d; This alludes to the fact that these behaviors are not commonly associated with a traditional romantic relationship. Given the apparent rise in the number of websites catering to paraphilia, atypical sexual behavior may be becoming more common.<br><br>You don&#x2019;t have to look too far for examples in public life of individuals who, like Jordan Haskins, had everything to lose&#x2014;�and lost it&#x2014;�when unusual or bizarre sexual behavior was exposed. I&#x2019;m thinking of U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner and the explicit photographs of himself that he sent to unsuspecting women he&#x2019;d met online. I&#x2019;m thinking of U.S. senator David Vitter and his urge to be diapered, which required the services of prostitutes. And I&#x2019;m thinking of New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who insisted on keeping on his calf-�length black socks when he had sex with a call girl. Remarkably enough, the marriages of these politicians survived after their unusual sexual habits came to light. The actor David Carradine, who was found dead and hanging inside a hotel room closet, wasn&#x2019;t so fortunate. According to an ex-�wife, he was into an extremely dangerous autoerotic asphyxiation paraphilia called hypoxyphilia, consisting of practices that restrict the flow of oxygen to the brain for sexual arousal. <br><br>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-�5, the most recent version of the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals worldwide, breaks down paraphilia into eight main types of disorders: exhibitionistic disorder, fetishistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder, pedophilic disorder, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, transvestic disorder, and voyeuristic disorder. The behavior being described in most of these terms is probably not too difficult to figure out, since the clinical words have entered common speech, with the exception of frotteurism, a disorder in which a person derives sexual pleasure or gratification by rubbing himself, or his genitalia, against another person&#x2014;�usually in a crowd (a good reason to avoid overly crowded subway cars at rush hour).</p><h2>Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela</h2><p>This item condition is New.

Among the book's interesting revelations is Mandela's ambivalence toward his lifetime of devotion to public works. It cost him two marriages and kept him distant from a family life he might otherwise have cherished. <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i> also discloses a strong and generous spirit that refused to be broken under the most trying circumstances--a spirit in which just about everybody can find something to admire.Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa&#39;s anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account of the unforgettable events since his release that produced at last a free, multiracial democracy in South Africa. To millions of people around the world, Nelson Mandela stands, as no other living figure does, for the triumph of dignity and hope over despair and hatred, of self-discipline and love over persecution and evil.</p><h2>The Christmas Cobwebs</h2><p>A poor shoemaker and his family move from Germany to Chicago with only a box of glittering glass ornaments.

The story&#39;s setting, a desert planet resembling the Old West, has encouraged the creation of larger-than-life characters who can get away with all kinds of bizarre behavior. One such character is the universally feared Vash the Stampede, who is not a murderous desperado but actually a man devoted to not killing any of the horde that&#39;s after the bounty on his head. Nightow hits readers with an avalanche of background information showing Vash as a child on the spaceship that brought settlers to the planet centuries ago. He saw Knives, one of the crew, try to sabotage the mission because he believed humanity had no right to exist. Ever since, Vash has been trying to keep descendants of the original settlers alive, but now Knives is being restored to life and sending a wave of assassins after Vash. From this unexpectedly serious premise, the story careens all over the place. Earlier characters are shoved aside, while new ones hover at the action&#39;s periphery. The conclusion suggests that neither Knives nor Vash were what they seemed, let alone altogether human. The art&#39;s raw kinetic energy makes each page fascinating, but readers may find their eyes are blinking and their ears are ringing when they put the book down.

Ann Fay Honeycutt accepts the role of "man of the house" when her father leaves because she wants to do her part for the war. She's doing well with the extra responsibilities when a frightening polio epidemic strikes, crippling many local children. Her town of Hickory responds by creating an emergency hospital in three days. Ann Fay reads each issue of the newspaper for the latest news of the epidemic.

She lives near Hickory.Gr. 4-7. Thirteen-year-old Ann Fay always wanted to be just like her father, but when he gives her a pair of overalls before going off to fight Hitler, her feelings are mixed: "Wearing britches so I could take the place of my daddy wasn't the same as wearing them so I could climb trees." [...] Hostetter weaves her own North Carolina community's history into heartfelt fiction, marked by an agreeable, vernacular narrative and unobtrusive symbolism surrounding the color blue--the hue of both Ann Fay's overalls and the pesky wisteria vine that, like grown-up responsibility made palpable, threatens to overtake her victory garden. An incongruous structural rift mars the novel's latter half, set in the polio hospital, where the heart-tugging family drama gives way to a programmatic story line about an obstacle-laden friendship between Ann Fay and an African American patient. Still, the intriguing history of the illness and the powerful first-person voice will propel readers through to the novel's deeply satisfying conclusion. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Rollins's observations range from the wry to the raucous in this blistering account of a six-year career with the band - a time marked by crazed fans, vicious cops, near-starvation, substance abuse, and mind numbing all-night drives. Rollins decided to revise this edition by adding a wealth of new photographs, a new foreword, and an afterword to include some "where-are-they-now" information on the people featured in the book. This new edition includes 40 previously unpublished black-and-white photographs from Rollins's private collection and show flyers by artist Raymond Pettibon. Called "a soul-frying experience not to be undertaken by lightweights" by <i>Wired</i> magazine, <i>Get in the Van</i> perfectly embodies what one critic called the "secular gospel" of one of punk and post-punk's most respected and controversial figures.</p><p>A day-by-day journal from the journals of the ever-volatile Henry Rollins on tour from 1981 to 1986 that captures the irrationality and violence of punk specifically, and the stresses of being on the road in a rock band generally.</p><h2>Christmas with Southern Living 2014: Our Best Guide to Holiday &amp; Decorating</h2><p><br><em>Christmas with Southern Living</em> is ALL NEW for 2014.

Osius, a senior editor for Climbing magazine, tells the story of "Boy Wonder" climber Herr, who at age 17 was already one of the sport's best. Then, during the winter of 1982 Herr and a climbing buddy were lost for three days in a Mt. Washington blizzard. Frostbite necessitated the amputation of both of his legs at the knees. Unwilling to bow to the initial pain and depression, Herr completed high school and began to climb again with the help of prosthetics. Astonishingly, he repeated his most difficult climbs and eventually surpassed his best. During his senior year in college, he was granted a patent for a new type of socket for prosthetic limbs. Herr's story is written in the language of this generation's climbers and should appeal to fans of the sport as well as other young people with accident-caused disabilities.<br><i>- Paula M. Strain, Rockville, Md.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- A story that is engrossing and inspiring. Rock climbing was Hugh Herr's sport and passion, and at age 17 he was considered one of the best. In 1982 he and a companion became lost during a blizzard on Mount Washington and assumed they would die. After three bitterly cold days on the mountain, they were rescued, but one rescuer died trying to save them. Herr had massive frostbite that eventually resulted in his legs having to be amputated. Following a period of despondency, he resolved to try climbing again, which he learned to do with the help of prostheses. Now he is involved in making artificial limbs for others. This is an extraordinary story of survival and the growth one experiences when put to the test. Photographs emphasize the amount of strength needed for this sport. One of the best handicapped-awareness books available, and a delight to booktalk. --Dorothy Addison, Woodlawn School, Fairfax County, VA<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Catholic Experience: A History from Colonial Times to the Present</h2><p>Spanning nearly 500 years, <i>The American Catholic Experience</i> describes the Catholic experience from the arrival of Columbus and the other European explorers to the present day. Jay P. Dolan discusses Catholicism as it spread across the New World, transforming&#x2015;and being transformed by&#x2015;the land and its people. The book traces the evolution of the urban ethnic communities by examining the vital contributions of the immigrant church to Catholicism. Finally, Dolan examines the controversy of the modern church and the extraordinary changes in the Catholic consciousness as it comes to grips with such contemporary social and theological issues as war and peace, the arms race, abortion, social justice, the ordination of women, and a married clergy.</p><p>Jay P. Dolan is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Notre Dame, where he founded the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism.Dolan writes in a lively manner and synthesizes vast amounts of material with a flair reminiscent of Martin Marty at his best. Tracing the history of Ca tholicism in America from the Spanish missions to the 1983 pastoral letter ``The Challenge of Peace,'' Dolan (who considers himself a social historian) de scribes the life and faith of the ``little'' people without ignoring the intellectual currents that swirled about them. De spite some occasional choppiness and confusion engendered by the book's mixed chronological/topical organiza tion, this is an admirable work that will appeal to general readers and still serve for academic use; indeed, the footnotes are a treasure trove for students and scholars of American Catholic history. Highly recommended. D. Stephen Rockwood, Mt. St. Mary's Coll.

Only Rebus seems to care about a death which looks more like a murder every day, about a seductive danger he can almost taste, appealing to the darkest corners of his mind ...</p><p>Ian Rankin is a worldwide #1 bestselling writer and has won an Edgar Award, a Gold Dagger for fiction, a Diamond Dagger for career excellence, and the Chandler-Fulbright Award. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.Hide!&#x2019; <p></p>He was shrieking now, frantic, his face drained of all colour. She was at the top of the stairs, and he stumbled towards her, grabbing her by the arms, propelling her downstairs with unfocussed force, so that she feared they would both fall. She cried out. <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie! Hide from who?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Hide!&#x2019; he shrieked again. &#x2018;Hide! They&#x2019;re coming! They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019; <p></p>He had pushed her all the way to the front door now. She&#x2019;d seen him pretty strung out before, but never this bad. A fix would help him, she knew it would. And she knew, too, that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom. The sweat trickled from his chilled rat&#x2019;s-tails of hair. Only two minutes ago, the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squat&#x2019;s seething lavatory. But now&#x2026;. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x2019; he repeated, his voice a whisper now. &#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x2019; <p></p>He stared at her, his eyes seeming almost to recognise her. Then he looked away again, into a distance all of his own. The word was a snakelike hiss. <p></p>&#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; And with that he yanked open the door. It was raining outside, and she hesitated. But then fear took her, and she made to cross the threshold. But his hand grabbed at her arm, pulling her back inside. He embraced her, his sweat sea-salty, his body throbbing. His mouth was close to her ear, his breath hot. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve murdered me,&#x2019; he said. Then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again, and this time she was outside, and the door was slamming shut, leaving him alone in the house. Alone with himself. She stood on the garden path, staring at the door, trying to decide whether to knock or not. <p></p>It wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. She knew that. So instead she started to cry. Her head slipped forward in a rare show of self-pity and she wept for a full minute, before, breathing hard three times, she turned and walked quickly down the garden path (such as it was). Someone would take her in. Someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes. <p></p>Someone always did. <p></p>JOHN REBUS stared hard at the dish in front of him, oblivious to the conversation around the table, the background music, the flickering candles. He didn&#x2019;t really care about house prices in Barnton, or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the Grassmarket. He didn&#x2019;t much want to speak to the other guests&#x2014;a female lecturer to his right, a male bookseller to his left&#x2014;about&#x2026; well, what ever they&#x2019;d just been discussing. Yes, it was the perfect dinner party, the conversation as tangy as the starter course, and he was glad Rian had invited him. Of course he was. But the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate, the more an unfocussed despair grew within him. What had he in common with these people? Would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head? No, they would not. They would smile politely, then bow their heads towards their plates, acknowledging that he was&#x2026; well, <i>different</i> from them. <p></p>&#x2018;Vegetables, John?&#x2019; <p></p>It was Rian&#x2019;s voice, warning him that he was not &#x2018;taking part&#x2019;, was not &#x2018;conversing&#x2019; or even looking interested. He accepted the large oval dish with a smile, but avoided her eyes. <p></p>She was a nice girl. Quite a stunner in an individual sort of way. Bright red hair, cut short and pageboyish. Eyes deep, striking green. Lips thin but promising. Oh yes, he liked her. He wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted her invitation otherwise. He fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldn&#x2019;t break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate. <p></p>&#x2018;Gorgeous food, Rian,&#x2019; said the bookseller, and Rian smiled, accepting the remark, her face reddening slightly. That was all it took, John. That was all you had to say to make this girl happy. But in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic. His tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing. It was a part of him, nurtured over a course of years. So when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller, all John Rebus did was smile and nod, the smile too fixed, the nod going on a second or two too long, so that they were all looking at him again. The piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth. <p></p>&#x2018;Shite!&#x2019; he said, knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate, not quite the <i>right</i> word for the occasion. Well, what was he, a man or a thesaurus? <p></p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t be helped,&#x2019; said Rian. My God, her voice was cold. <p></p>It was the perfect end to a perfect weekend. He&#x2019;d gone shopping on Saturday, ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight. But had baulked at the prices, and bought some books instead, one of which was intended as a gift to Rian: <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But then he&#x2019;d decided he&#x2019;d like to read it himself first, and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead, forgetting her aversion to lilies ( <i>had he known in the first place?</i>) and the diet she was in the throes of starting. Damn. And to cap it all, he&#x2019;d tried a new church this morning, another Church of Scotland offering, not too far from his flat. The last one he&#x2019;d tried had seemed unbearably cold, promising nothing but sin and repentance, but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite: all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway? So he&#x2019;d sung the hymns, then buggered off, leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance. <p></p>&#x2018;More wine, John?&#x2019; <p></p>This was the bookseller, proffering the bottle he&#x2019;d brought himself. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad little wine, actually, but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that Rebus felt obliged to decline. The man frowned, but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself. He replenished his glass with vigour. <p></p>&#x2018;Cheers,&#x2019; he said. <p></p>The conversation returned to how busy Edinburgh seemed these days. Here was something with which Rebus could agree. This being the end of May, the tourists were almost in season. But there was more to it than that. If anyone had told him five years ago that in 1989 people would be emigrating north from the south of England to the Lothians, he&#x2019;d have laughed out loud. Now it was fact, and a fit topic for the dinner table. <p></p>Later, much later, the couple having departed, Rebus helped Rian with the dishes. <p></p>&#x2018;What was wrong with you?&#x2019; she said, but all he could think about was the minister&#x2019;s handshake, that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife. <p></p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s leave these till morning.&#x2019; <p></p>Rian stared at the kitchen, counting the used pots, the half-eaten lobster carcasses, the wine glasses smudged with grease. <p></p>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What did you have in mind instead?&#x2019; <p></p>He raised his eyebrows slowly, then brought them down low over his eyes. His lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer. She became coy. <p></p>&#x2018;Why, Inspector,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is that supposed to be some kind of a clue?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s another,&#x2019; he said, lunging at her, hugging her to him, his face buried in her neck. She squealed, clenched fists beating against his back. <p></p>&#x2018;Police brutality!&#x2019; she gasped. &#x2018;Help! Police, help!&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Yes, madam?&#x2019; he inquired, carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen, towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow. <p></p>LATE EVE NING at a building site on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The contract was for the construction of an office development. A fifteen-foot-high fence separated the works from the main road. The road, too, was of recent vintage, built to help ease traffic congestion around the city. Built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre. <p></p>There were no cars on the road to night. The only sound came from the slow chug-chugging of a cement mixer on the site. A man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site. Hard graft it had been, but honest. <p></p>Two other men stood above a deep pit, staring down into it. &#x2018;Should do it,&#x2019; one said. <p></p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; the other agreed. They began walking back to the car, an ageing purple Mercedes. <p></p>&#x2018;He must have some clout. I mean, to get us the keys to this place, to set all this up. Some clout.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ours is not to ask questions, you know that.&#x2019; The man who spoke was the oldest of the three, and the only Calvinist. He opened the car boot. Inside, the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled, obviously dead. His skin was the colour of pencil shading, darkest where the bruises lay. <p></p>&#x2018;What a waste,&#x2019; said the Calvinist. <p></p>&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019; the other agreed. Together they lifted the body from the boot, and carried it gently towards the hole. It dropped softly to the bottom, one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides, a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle. <p></p>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; the Calvinist said to the cement man. &#x2018;Cover it, and let&#x2019;s get out of here.

Cronin is a remarkable storyteller (just ask adoring fans of his award-winning <em>Mary and O'Neil</em>), whose gorgeous writing brings depth and vitality to this ambitious epic about a virus that nearly destroys the world, and a six-year-old girl who holds the key to bringing it back. <em>The Passage</em> takes readers on a journey from the early days of the virus to the aftermath of the destruction, where packs of hungry infected scour the razed, charred cities looking for food, and the survivors eke out a bleak, brutal existence shadowed by fear. Cronin doesn't shy away from identifying his "virals" as vampires. But, these are not sexy, angsty vampires (you won&#x2019;t be seeing "Team Babcock" t-shirts any time soon), and they are not old-school, evil Nosferatus, either. These are a creation all Cronin's own--hairless, insectile, glow-in-the-dark mutations who are inextricably linked to their makers and the one girl who could destroy them all. A huge departure from Cronin's first two novels, <em>The Passage</em> is a grand mashup of literary and supernatural, a stunning beginning to a trilogy that is sure to dazzle readers of both genres. --<em>Daphne Durham</em></p> <strong>Dan Chaon Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong> <p><b>Dan Chaon is the acclaimed author of the national bestseller <em>Await Your Reply</em> and <em>You Remind Me of Me</em>, which was named one of the best books of the year by <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, among other publications. Chaon lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College. Read his review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>There is a particular kind of reading experience--the feeling you get when you can&#x2019;t wait to find out what happens next, you can&#x2019;t turn the pages fast enough, and yet at the same time you are so engaged in the world of the story and the characters, you don&#x2019;t want it to end. It&#x2019;s a rare and complex feeling--that plot urgency pulling you forward, that yearning for more holding you back. We say that we are swept up, that we are taken away. Perhaps this effect is one of the true magic tricks that literature can offer to us, and yet it doesn&#x2019;t happen very often. Mostly, I think, we remember this experience from a few of the beloved books of our childhood.</p> <p>About three-quarters of the way through <em>The Passage</em>, I found myself in the grip of that peculiar and intense readerly emotion. One part of my brain couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to the next big revelation, and I found myself wanting to leapfrog from paragraph to paragraph, hurtling toward each looming climax. Meanwhile, another part of my brain was watching the dwindling final pages with dread, knowing that things would be over soon, and wishing to linger with each sentence and character a little while longer.</p> <p>Finishing <em>The Passage</em> for the first time, I didn&#x2019;t bother to put it on a shelf, because I knew I would be flipping back through its pages again the next day. Rereading. Considering. </p> <p>Certain kinds of books draw us into the lives of their characters, into their inner thoughts, to the extent that we seem to know them, as well as we know real people. Readers of Justin Cronin&#x2019;s earlier books, <em>Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</em> and <em>The Summer Guest</em>, will recognize him as an extraordinarily insightful chronicler of the ways in which people maneuver through the past, and through loss, grief and love. Though <em>The Passage</em> is a different sort of book, Cronin hasn&#x2019;t lost his skill for creating deeply moving character portraits. Throughout, in moments both large and small, readers will find the kind of complicated and heartfelt relationships that Cronin has made his specialty. Though the cast of characters is large, they are never mere pawns. The individual lives are brought to us with a vivid tenderness, and at the center of the story is not only vampires and gun battles but also quite simply a quiet meditation on the love of a man for his adopted daughter. As a fan of Cronin&#x2019;s earlier work, I found it exciting to see him developing these thoughtful character studies in an entirely different context.</p> <p>There are also certain kinds of books expand outwards beyond the borders of their covers. They make us wish for encyclopedias and maps, genealogies and indexes, appendixes that detail the adventures of the minor characters we loved but only briefly glimpsed. <em>The Passage</em> is that kind of book, too. There is a dense web of mythology and mystery that roots itself into your brain--even as you are turning the pages as quickly as you can. Complex secrets and untold stories peer out from the edges of the plot in a way that fires the imagination, so that the world of the novel seems to extend outwards, a whole universe--parts of which we glimpse in great detail--and yet we long to know even more. I hope it won&#x2019;t be saying too much to say that there are actually two universes in this novel, one overlapping the other: there is the world before the virus, and the world after, and one of the pleasures of the book is the way that those two worlds play off one another, each one twisting off into a garden of forking and intertwined paths. I think, for example, of the scientist Jonas Lear, and his journey to a fabled site in the jungles of Bolivia where clouds of bats descend upon his team of researchers; or the little girl, Amy, whose trip to the zoo sets the animals into a frenzy--"They know what I am," she says; or one of the men in Dr. Lear&#x2019;s experiment, Subject Zero, monitored in his cell as he hangs "like some kind of giant insect in the shadows." These characters and images weave their way through the story in different forms, recurring like icons, and there are threads to be connected, and threads we cannot quite connect--yet. And I hope that there will be some questions that will not be solved at all, that will just exist, as the universe of <em>The Passage</em> takes on a strange, uncanny life of its own. </p> <p>It takes two different kinds of books to work a reader up into that hypnotic, swept away feeling. The author needs to create both a deep intimacy with the characters, and an expansive, strange-but-familiar universe that we can be immersed in. <em>The Passage</em> is one of those rare books that has both these elements. I envy those readers who are about to experience it for the first time. </p> <p><strong>Danielle Trussoni Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong></p> <p><b>Danielle Trussoni is the author of <em>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</em>, which was the recipient of the 2006 Michener-Copernicus Society of America Award, a BookSense pick, and one of <em>The New York Times</em> Ten Best Books of 2006. Her first novel <em>Angelology</em> will be published in 30 countries. Read her review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Justin Cronin&#x2019;s <em>The Passage</em> is a dark morality tale of just how frightening things can become when humanity transgresses the laws of nature.</p> <p>The author of two previous novels, Cronin, in his third book, imagines the catastrophic possibilities of a vampiric bat virus unleashed upon the world. Discovered by the U.S. Military in South America, the virus is transported to a laboratory in the Colorado mountains where it is engineered to create a more invincible soldier. The virus&#x2019; potential benefits are profound: it has the power to make human beings immortal and indestructible. Yet, like Prometheus&#x2019; theft of fire from the Gods, knowledge and technological advancement are gained at great price: After the introduction of the virus into the human blood pool, it becomes clear that there will be hell to pay. The guinea pigs of the NOAH experiment, twelve men condemned to die on death row, become a superhuman race of vampire-like creatures called Virals. Soon, the population of the earth is either dead or infected, their minds controlled telepathically by the Virals. As most of human civilization has been wiped out by the Virals, the few surviving humans create settlements and live off the land with a fortitude the pilgrims would have admired. Only Amy, an abandoned little girl who becomes a mystical antidote to the creatures&#x2019; powers, will be able to save the world.</p> <p><em>The Passage</em> is no quick read, but a sweeping dystopian epic that will utterly transport one to another world, a place both haunting and horrifying to contemplate. Cronin weaves together multiple story lines that build into a journey spanning one hundred years and nearly 800 pages. While vampire lore lurks in the background--the Virals nick necks in order to infect humans, are immortal and virtually indestructible, and do most of their hunting at night--Cronin is more interested in creating an apocalyptic vision along the lines of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s <em>The Road</em>.</p> <p>Taking place in a futuristic America where New Orleans is a military zone, Jenna Bush is the Governor of Texas and citizens are under surveillance, <em>The Passage</em> offers a gruesome and twisted version of reality, a terrifying dream world in which our very worst nightmares come true. Ultimately, like the best fiction, <em>The Passage</em> explores what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming adversity. The thrill comes with the knowledge that Amy and the Virals must face off in a grand battle for the fate of humanity.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Justin Cronin</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is <em>The Passage</em>?<br> <b>A:</b> A passage is, of course, a journey, and the novel is made up of journeys. But the notion of a journey in the novel, and indeed in the whole trilogy, is also metaphoric. A passage is a transition from one state or condition to another. The world itself makes such a transition in the book. So do all the characters&#x2014;as characters in a novel must. The title is also a reference to the soul&#x2019;s passage from life to death, and whatever lies in that unknown realm. Time and time again I&#x2019;ve heard it, and in my own life, witnessed it: people at the end of life want to go home. It is a literal longing, I think, to leave this world while in a place of meaning, among familiar things and faces. But it is also a celestial longing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You are a PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author of literary fiction. Does <em>The Passage</em> represent a departure for you?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it&#x2019;d be a little silly of me not to acknowledge that <em>The Passage</em> is, in a number of ways, overtly different from my other books. But rather than calling it a &#x2018;departure,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d prefer to describe it as a progression or evolution. First of all, the themes that engage me as a person and a writer are all still present. Love, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, courage. The bonds between people, parents and children especially. The pull of history, and the power of place, of landscape, to shape experience. And I don&#x2019;t think the writing itself is different at all. How could it be? You write how you write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <em>The Passage</em> takes place all across America--from Philadelphia to Houston to southern California. What prompted you to choose these specific locations?<br> <b>A:</b> Many of the major locations in the novel are, in fact, places I have lived. Except for a long stint in Philadelphia, and now Houston, my life has been a bit nomadic. I was raised in the Northeast, but after college, I ping-ponged all over the country for a while. In some ways, shaking off my strictly Northeastern point of view has been the central project of my adult life. This gave me not only a sense of the sheer immensity of the continent, but also the great diversity of its textures, both geographical and cultural, and I wanted the book to capture this feeling of vastness, especially when the narrative jumps forward a hundred years and the continent has become depopulated. One of the most striking impressions of my travels across the country is how empty a lot of it is. You can pull off the road in Kansas or Nevada or Utah or Texas and stand in the quiet with only the wind for company and it seems as if civilization has already ended, that you&#x2019;re all alone on the planet. It&#x2019;s a wonderful and a terrifying feeling at the same time, and while I was writing the book, I decided I would travel every mile my characters did, in order to capture not only the details of place, but the feeling of place.<br><br> The writer Charles Baxter once said (more or less) that you know you&#x2019;ve come to the end of a story when you&#x2019;ve found a way to get your characters back to where they started. The end of <em>The Passage</em> is meant to create another beginning, and the space for book two to unfold.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your daughter was the spark that set your writing of <em>The Passage</em> in motion. What else drove you to delve into such an epic undertaking?<br> <b>A:</b> The other force at work was something more personal and writerly. One of the reasons that the story of <em>The Passage</em> had such a magnetic effect on me was that I felt myself reclaiming the impulses that led me to become a writer in the first place. Like my daughter, I was a big reader as a kid. I lived in the country, with no other kids around, and spent most of my childhood either with my nose in a book or wandering around the woods with my head in some imagined narrative or another. It was much later, of course, that I formally became a student of literature, and decided that writing was something I wanted to do professionally. But the groundwork was all laid back then, reading with a flashlight under the covers.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you have the narrative completely mapped out before you started, or did certain developments take you by surprise?<br> <b>A: </b> I had it mostly mapped out, but the book is in charge. I split and recombined some characters (mostly secondary ones.) I tend to think in terms of general narrative goals; the details work themselves out as you go, just so long as you remember the destination. And to that extent, the book followed the map I made with my daughter quite closely.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> When will we get to read the next book?<br> <b>A:</b> Two years (fingers wishfully crossed). </p> <br><p><b>Justin Cronin </b>is the author of <i>The Passage, Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</i> (which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize), and <i>The Summer Guest</i>. Other honors for his writing include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a Whiting Writers&#x2019; Award.

The story is set in the distant future of Pournelle&#39;s CoDominium universe, and charts the first contact between humanity and an alien species. The Mote in God&#39;s Eye was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards in 1975. The Mote In God&#39;s Eye is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel of mankind&#39;s first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre. And as space-opera spectacle, it has withstood the test of time -- a true original, as clever as it is imaginative. Set in the year 3017, when man has long colonized space, it tells an engrossing tale of first contact, utterly inhuman aliens who harbor a dark secret, and humanity&#39;s unique solution to a potentially dangerous situation. The Alderson drive has made it possible for humans to shunt between systems in zero time, and, having never encountered another intelligent species, man reign</p><p></p><h2>Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think</h2><p><p>A revelatory exploration of the hottest trend in technology and the dramatic impact it will have on the economy, science, and society at large.<br><br>Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? <br><br>The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. &#x201c;Big data&#x201d; refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena&#x2014;from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books&#x2014;into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven&#x2019;t even done yet, based on big data&#x2019;s ability to predict our future behavior.<br><br>In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. <i>Big Data </i>is the first big book about the next big thing.</p><p>www.big-data-book.com<br></p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What did it take to write <em>Big Data</em>?</strong></p> <p>A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for <em>The Economist</em>, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book <em>Delete</em> had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted <em>Big Data</em> to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are you big data&#x2019;s cheerleaders?</strong></p> <p>A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big data&#x2019;s likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it.</p> <p><strong>Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise?</strong></p> <p>A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing people&#x2019;s everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Q. Is <em>Big Data</em> then primarily a story about economic efficiency?</strong></p> <p>A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but that&#x2019;s only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal change&#x2014;from urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life.</p> <p><strong>Q. So big data offers only &#x201c;upside&#x201d;? </strong></p> <p>A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book &#x201c;the dark side of big data.&#x201d; However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by &#x201c;propensity&#x201d; -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the &#x201c;fetishization&#x201d; of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations.</p> <p><strong>Q. What can we do about this &#x201c;dark side&#x201d;?</strong></p> <p>A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big data&#x2019;s risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues. If we do not take action soon, it might be too late.</p>HMH&nbsp;Hardcover, 2013 Previous ISBN:&nbsp;978-0-544-00269-2</p><h2>Be Happy: Remember to Live, Love, Laugh and Learn (Gift of Inspiration, 12)</h2><p>Now in its ninth printing, Be Happy has become one of Compendium&#39;s all-time best-selling gift books.

Karma&#34;</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: JapaneseIn this first collection of short fiction, Abe confirms his reputation as one of Japan's most significant modern writers. The tightly drawn, surrealistic tales proceed from the same premise: an ordinary individual is suddenly thrust into extraordinary, often nightmarish circumstances that lead him to question his identity. In "An Irrelevant Death," a man returns from work to confront a corpse in his apartment. Contemplating ways to get rid of the body, he finds himself increasingly implicated in the stranger's death. On a lighter note, "Dendrocacalia" describes the plight of a bewildered man named Common, who discovers he has turned into a rare plant, placed in a botanical garden. The almost lulling repetitiveness of "Record of a Transformation" underscores the senseless brutality of war as, at the height of battle, an executed soldier describes his horrifying experiences among the dead and the living. The beautifully conceived title story describes the actions of a man with amnesia trying to remember his past just "beyond the curve." Abe blends elements of suspense and science fiction to create a form singularly his own. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lady &amp; Sons, Too!: A Whole New Batch of Recipes from Savannah</h2><p><b>The Lady &amp; Sons, Too! </b>is a brand-new collection of recipes from Paula Deen, owner of Savannah's Lady &amp; Sons restaurant and one of QVC's all-time bestselling cookbook authors.

She lives in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania.<br>Grade 2-5-Ray traces the development of Bartram's passion for learning about nature, first as an assistant to his father, botanist John Bartram, and then as a partner with unique interests of his own. Told through first-person journal entries, the story begins on William's eighth birthday in 1747 and follows his developing observational and drawing skills, his friendship with Benjamin Franklin, and the various expeditions he took with his father through the northeast colonies. An adult William accompanied the elder Bartram to Florida, then stayed there for 10 years to explore the flora and fauna of this wild land and became friends with various Native peoples, including the Seminole, who christened him "Puc Puggy" (flower hunter). An afterword fills in some of the gaps left by the narrative and offers a detailed listing of the many specimens identified by the Bartrams. The delicate watercolor-and-gouache illustrations capture the quiet joy that William found in nature, and the accompanying text is printed against a parchment background that simulates his diary, complete with labeled pencil sketches of plants and animals. The journal format means skipping great portions of Bartram's life, which is a bit jarring; major events, such as the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War, are briefly mentioned. Overall, however, this quiet book is a fitting tribute to a dedicated and talented naturalist.<br><i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How then, should a company decide which broad path, or strategy, to commit itself to? And how are competition and uncertainty to be accounted for in that decision? In this brilliant reassessment of how companies gain and sustain competitive advantage, Pankaj Ghemawat consolidates contemporary research in economics and other disciplines into a comprehensive yet practical framework for comparing commitments to strategically distinct options. This framework will help managers address specific strategic choices such as entry, exit, vertical/horizontal integration, capacity expansion, and innovation, as well as choices of generic strategy. Step by systematic step, Ghemawat provides managers with the tools and techniques they need to improve the quality of the choices that they make. Specifically, Ghemawat discusses: * how to identify the choices that are truly strategic -- that involve commitment -- before rather than after the fact * how to analyze the short-run and long-run competitive positions implied by a particular strategic option * how to assess the sustainability of superior competitive positions over time * how to account for the flexibility afforded by a particular option in dealing with future uncertainties * how to deal with both honest mistakes and deliberate distortions in the process of choice This pathbreaking book will help managers invest in the future. Its logic applies to choices involving disinvestment as well as those involving investment -- and to choices that embody elements of both. Its logic can be used for diagnostic purposes, such as the valuation of business, and most broadly, it win force managers to think about important issues that they may have tended to ignore. Ghemawat&#39;s discussion of these important ideas is concise, studded with detailed examples, based on rigorous research and, above all, practical. It will become required reading for thoughtful practitioners as well as practitionersto-be in the 1990s.</p><p><b>Pankaj Ghemawat</b> is professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School.

Barnard, <i>The Functions of the Executive</i> </p><p> Something has gone wrong with using strategy as a guide to managerial action. Indexes of business periodicals suggest that while the concept of strategy gained share in the market for business ideas in the 1970s, it lost market share in the 1980s. This decline does <i>not</i> reflect a perception that the problem of strategy has practically been solved. Rather, the perception that seems to have developed is that while strategy is easy to formulate, it is awfully hard to implement. As a result, an increasing fraction of what does get written about strategy calls, in effect, for abandoning the concept. Those who might oppose such calls seem to be preoccupied, instead, with arguing the superiority of their particular strategic doctrine over all others. What went wrong? History suggests a concise answer to that question. </p><p> Strategy has come to focus on success factors. </p><p> Chester Barnard (1938) introduced strategy to business with his discussion of strategic factors; the epigraph to this chapter is a sample, Barnard recognized the managerial impossibility of apprehending and acting all at once on the many factors that impinge on organizational performance. He therefore suggested focusing on and changing one factor at a time. This strategic factor was supposed to be selected so as to capitalize on complementarities: so as to allow a favorable change in the total situation <i>via</i> a change in one of its parts. </p><p> The example of potash, which most of us never have to worry about, should hint at the situationality of the original conception of the strategic factor. But Barnard (1938, p. 204) went even farther than that: </p><p> When the need [for potash] has been determined, a new situation has arisen because of the fact of knowledge or assumption that potash is the limiting factor; and instead of potash, the limiting factor <i>obtaining potash</i> then becomes the strategic factor; and this will change progressively into <i>obtaining</i> the money to <i>buy</i> potash, then <i>finding</i> John to go after potash, then <i>getting</i> machines and men to <i>spread</i> potash, etc., etc. Thus the determination of the strategic factor is itself the decision which at once reduces purpose to a new level, compelling search for a new strategic factor in the new situation. </p><p> In other words, the strategic factor was originally conceived of as a will-o'-the-wisp. </p><p> This conception proved, predictably, to be impractically intricate. As a result, the field of strategy lay dormant for a while. It was not until the 1950s or 1960s (depending on whose claims to priority one credits) that refinements to Barnard's concept began to be proposed. While the refinements were various, they all implied the usefulness of more stable bases for strategic abstraction than Barnard's short-lived successive constraints. The most alluring expedient was to hunt for stable bases of success, for <i>success factors.</i> The search for success factors is what the enterprise of strategy has largely been about ever since. </p><p> The last statement will be controversial. One way to corroborate it would be to classify beliefs about strategy and explain why the prescriptions of each "school" do in fact rest on success factors. Such surveys of the field of strategy seem, however, to be in excess supply rather than in excess demand. I will therefore use a specific case to illustrate the reliance of managers and would-be managers on success factors. </p><p> The case concerns Wal-Mart Stores' discount retailing business. In the 1970s and 1980s, that business grew at an annual rate of 40%, generated an annual return on equity (ROE) of 35%, and made the company's founder, Mr. Sam Walton, the richest person and one of the most celebrated managers in the United States. By 1990, Wal-Mart was on the verge of surpassing both Sears, Roebuck and K Mart to become the largest general-merchandise retailer in the United States. I chose to write a case about this situation because it was evidently ripe for strategic deconstruction. The strategic lessons drawn from the Wal-Mart case play across a spectrum of success factors, some of which are elaborated on below. </p><p> Market Power </p><p> An unusually high proportion of Wal-Mart's stores were located in small towns where there was no local competition from other discounters. So although its operating expenses were 8% lower than the average for other discounters (partly because of its rural focus), it priced only 5% below them. In other words, market power allowed Wal-Mart to hang on to some of its cost advantage as a discounter instead of being forced to pass all the savings on to its customers. </p><p> Time-based Competition </p><p> Wal-Mart had developed the capability of responding exceptionally quickly to changes in consumer buying patterns. Private communications links let it obtain feedback from its stores within 90 minutes of the time they closed and alter the mix of products being shipped to its stores at least once each day, if not more often. Wal-Mart also managed to replenish the stock in its stores twice a week on average, compared to once every two weeks for Sears, Roebuck and K Mart. </p><p> Organization </p><p> Wal-Mart's organization seemed attuned to the distinctive requirements of running a multisite service operation. Although most operating decisions at Wal-Mart were unusually decentralized (down to the store level), top management received unusually detailed numbers on operating performance and paid an unusual amount of attention to them. In addition, all top managers spent three or four days a week in the field visiting Wal-Mart stores to get a sense of developments that might not be evident from the numbers. To cap things off, there had historically been little separation of ownership and management at the top of the pyramid. Wal-Mart had been run actively by Sam Walton, its founder and principal shareholder, until he retired as chief executive officer in 1988. </p><p> Total Customer Satisfaction </p><p> Wal-Mart is often said to have practiced total customer satisfaction. Its most profitable stores were the ones that offered customers the broadest and best mix of merchandise of any store in the area, and at consistently lower prices, too. And even when Wal-Mart faced competitors that carried much the same merchandise at comparable prices in look-alike stores (e.g., K Mart), it managed to secure higher consumer ratings. Wal-Mart's logo, its greeters and other little touches had all been cited in this context, leading us to the next story about its success. </p><p> Learning </p><p> David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive officer in 1988, described discount retailing as a business of details, one in which there were many ways for Wal-Mart to lose the three extra percentage points of operating margin it earned in the mid-1980s. Wal-Mart had clearly gone to great lengths to learn how best to handle details. According to one inspired analyst's report, loading trucks to minimize store space devoted to the back room, unpacking boxes, scheduling part-time labor, displaying jeans to promote tie-in sales of hats, juggling fixture heights for maximum impact and hundreds of other activities had all been analyzed (not just answered) by the company over the years. </p><p> Empowerment </p><p> Discount retailing is a labor-intensive business in which shop floor workers play a critical role in overall operating efficiency. But they are also a major cost element: payroll expenses account for about 40% of the value added in this business. Such considerations place a premium on trying to motivate workers by empowering them, instead of simply paying them more. There were several indications that Wal-Mart had compiled an exceptional record in this regard. For instance, it had been voted one of the hundred best companies to work for in the United States, in spite of its relatively tightfisted pay scale. </p><p> Leadership </p><p> As founder, controlling owner, hands-on manager and cheerleader, Sam Walton had played an atypically important role at Wal-Mart. Many Wal-Mart watchers tended to see the company as the shadow of the man at the top. In their eyes, Walton was the company's real success factor because of the leadership he offered in areas such as frugality, customer-sensitivity, and enthusiasm. "Hard" evidence of Walton's contribution included the grisly observation that the price of Wal-Mart stock had slumped when it was first announced that he had leukemia. </p><p> This list has covered only a few fashionable success factors, not all the ones that are proposed in the case of Wal-Mart. My sense, however, is that while additional success factors such as configuration, location, market share and strategic intent could, be retrofitted to the Wal-Mart story, the exercise would be tedious, rather than necessary. The managerial tendency to abstract about strategy in terms of success factors should already be clear. </p><p> Success factors are a shaky foundation for strategy. </p><p> Success factors have their uses, some of which will be discussed later in this book. It would not be sensible, however, to base the entire edifice of strategy on them, for four reasons. First, it is usually hard to identify the success factors relevant to a particular situation. Second, even when a success factor has been diagnosed to be relevant, the implications for the levers managers must pull are not completely concrete. Third, the success factor approach lacks generality because it implicitly assumes that success factors are undervalued. Finally, in view of its other defects, it would be reassuring if the success factor approach to strategy contained some self-justification: a reason why strategic thinking is necessary in the first place. It does not. The rest of this section elaborates on these four defects. </p><p> Lack of Identification </p><p> The generic success factors flagged in the previous section range across the imaginable spectrum, from the bright economic lights of market power, in which no human beings are visible, to the shadowier tones of empowerment and leadership, in which humans are all. Their diversity reflects the fact that strategists currently worship at many separate churches. It is sometimes asserted that such diversity isn't a bad thing. Managers cannot, however, be so ecumenical. Having to track the full complement of success factors flagged in the case of Wal-Mart would virtually be equivalent to having to track everything. This could only be construed as a repudiation of the search for managerially useful abstractions inaugurated by Chester Barnard. </p><p> Nor does contingency theory, with its emphasis on the uniqueness of each situation, promise much relief. A contingent perspective on success factors would imply that the ones to focus on depend on the specifics of the situation. This might seem useful in narrowing the number of success factors to be tracked in any specific situation. Unfortunately, agreement is frequently as elusive on specific success factors as on generic ones. The specifics of the Wal-Mart case, for instance, lend themselves to a host of interpretations, each purporting to explain all by itself the company's ability to earn an operating margin of 7.7% on its 1984 revenues versus 4.8% for the average discount retailer. While several (if not all) of the success factors cited above can be dressed up into "complete" explanations of Wal-Mart's above-average profitability, boredom-through-repetition will be minimized by considering a fresh one: <i>configurational efficiency.</i> </p><p> Wal-Mart's configuration differed from other discounters' in two respects: an unusually high proportion of its in-bound merchandise moved to its stores via its distribution centers instead of directly, and its regional vice presidents operated out of corporate headquarters instead of offices in the field. According to the company's own calculations, this configuration created efficiencies on the order of 3% to 4% of revenues. Thus Wal-Mart's superior profitability might entirely be attributed to the efficiency of its configuration. Yet surely there was more to its success than the architecture of its system. </p><p> The embarrassing abundance of candidate success factors and the consequent difficulty of figuring out which one(s) to focus on reflect more than just the juiciness of the Wal-Mart story. Both conditions tend to be chronic, for the following reason. Barnard's notion of the strategic factor was conceived around factor complementarities, around the whole being more than the sum of its parts. This conception has been retained in the subsequent search for success factors. But it is well known, at least to economists and accountants, that the sum of the marginal products of complementary factors will exceed their total product. In other words, complementarities imply that it will be easy to propose success factors that promise a big bang per increment of managerial effort, and correspondingly hard to figure out which one(s) to focus on. Since strategy does demand such a focus, this compromises the usefulness of the success factor approach. </p><p> Lack of Concreteness </p><p> Even if the relevant success factor(s) can be identified, that does not quite solve the managerial problem of what to do about it. The problem is that the mechanism that is supposed to mediate between the organization's stock of success factors and its performance is black-boxed, in the sense that the causal processes that make it work in concrete situations are not spelled out. More precisely, the success factor approach rests not only on abstract objects (which have been deemed necessary to strategy) but also on hermetic laws about their effects. </p><p> This lack of concreteness and the complications it creates are clearest in the case of "soft" success factors. Consider, for instance, the success factor of leadership. The inference that leadership is important does not tell managers how to improve their leadership quotient. Rather, the diversity of organizational situations ensures the diversity of the levers that managers must actually pull to become more effective leaders. </p><p> This problem is not peculiar to soft success factors. At the other end of the spectrum, even the "hard" success factor of market power is no more than a conceptual filing cabinet (albeit an exceptionally useful one) whose specific contents vary from situation to situation. What a manager must do to help the organization accumulate market power is necessarily specialized to the situation at hand. </p><p> Once again, the problem runs deeper than may be apparent at first glance. One of the major themes of the philosophy of science in the 1980s was that attempts to explain <i>any</i> phenomenon in terms of abstract objects (e.g., organizational performance in terms of success factors) require specificity about the causal processes that actually connect the abstract objects and real, observable variables. By implication, overarching laws can be uncovered only if high-level causal processes ca...</p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Hassle Me With Your Sighs, Chuck (Peanuts Parade ; 12)</h2><p>A selection of cartoons including those in which Peppermint Patty flies Snoopy&#39;s Sopwith camel in the Powder Puff Derby.</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Frigate</h2><p>A young man dares not return to England after his ship is taken over by pirates and he becomes a member of their crew.</p><p>In seventeenth century England, a terrible accident forces orphaned Philip Marsham to flee London in fear for his life.

In quality and compelling scope, this is Rushdie's&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>--an unparalleled modern-day American thriller, with wonderful, moving characters and a grippingly entertaining story straight out of today's headlines, set against the panorama of American culture and politics from the inauguration of Obama to post-election Trump.</b><br><br>When powerful real-estate tycoon Nero Golden immigrates to the States under mysterious circumstances, he and his three adult children assume new identities, reinventing themselves as emperors living in a lavish house in downtown Manhattan. Arriving shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama, he and his sons, each extraordinary in his own right, quickly establish themselves at the apex of New York society, even as Nero Golden continues to raise huge buildings carrying his name in gold letters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story of the powerful Golden family is told from the point of view of their Manhattanite neighbour and confidant, Ren�, an aspiring filmmaker who finds in the Goldens the perfect subject. Ren� chronicles the undoing of the house of Golden: the high life of money, of art and fashion, a sibling quarrel, an unexpected metamorphosis, the arrival of a beautiful former model, betrayal and murder, and far away, in their abandoned homeland, some decent intelligence work that could ruin Nero Golden forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invoking literature, pop culture and the cinema, Rushdie spins the story of the American zeitgeist over the last eight years, hitting every beat: the rise of the birther movement, the Tea Party, and identity politics; Gamergate; the backlash against political correctness; the ascendancy of Superman and Batwoman and the superhero movie; and, of course, the insurgence of a ruthlessly ambitious, narcissistic villain with painted skin and coloured hair.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2017:</strong> The events of <em>The Golden House</em> begin around Obama's inauguration and end in our current time--and it is a novel about our times--but it is also a story steeped in Greek tragedy and the history of cinema. Nero Golden is a wealthy immigrant with three sons who has moved from Mumbai to New York under mysterious circumstances. He takes up residence in a downtown mansion, where he acquires a beautiful Russian second wife (one could argue just as strenuously that she acquires him). Nero, his new wife, and his sons establish their respective places in New York society, and their stories are told through the eyes of Rene, an aspiring film maker who lives across the street and who becomes entangled in the rapidly unwinding drama of the Golden family. What follows is an entertaining and enlightening novel with much to say about modern America. This is a story with roots and antecedents stretching into the past, but it feels as relevant and timely as anything you'll read today. <em>--Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em>Sir SALMAN RUSHDIE is the multi-award winning author of twelve previous novels--<i>Luka and the Fire of Life</i>, <i>Grimus</i>, <i>Midnight's Children </i>(which won the Booker Prize, 1981, and the Best of the Booker Prize, 2008), <i>Shame,The Satanic Verses</i>, <i>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</i>, <i>The Moor's Last Sigh</i>, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i>, <i>Fury</i>, <i>Shalimar the Clown</i> and <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i>--and one collection of short stories, <i>East, West</i>.

Although his fable, <i>King Matt the First</i>, has been available in translation, his writings about children have not been. And while this present volume of selections may seem slim, Korczak's insights are profound. The opening selection, "No Book Is a Substitute," reminds readers not to trust childcare books more than their own thoughtful observations. Watch a child take off and put back on a shoe or sock, over and over. This is not "a senseless waste of time," Korczak says, but "real work," part of the child's development. Likewise, play is essential to children&#x2014;it's the only time we allow children "to take the initiative." Are you frustrated by something your child's done? Try seeing that child as a "foreigner who does not speak our language... ignorant of the laws and customs.... Treat his ignorance with respect." In this perfect inspirational gift book, Korczak reminds readers that children are basically honest, so if they don't answer our questions, that's also an answer; rather than lie, they're choosing silence. Editor Joseph closes with a biographical sketch of Korczak, useful for readers discovering this remarkable man for the first time. <i>(Feb. 23)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on his extensive talks with Seeger, <i>New Yorker</i> writer Alec Wilkinson lets us experience the man&#x2019;s unique blend of independence and commitment, charm, courage, energy, and belief in human equality and American democracy.<br><br>We see Seeger instilled with a love of music by his parents, both classically trained musicians; as a teenager, hearing real folk music for the first time; and as a young man, singing with Woody Guthrie and with the Weavers. We learn of his harassment by the government for his political beliefs and his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1949. And we follow his engagement with civil rights, the peace movement, and the environment&#x2014;especially his work saving the Hudson River and building the ship <i>Clearwater</i>. He talks ardently about his own music and that of others, and about the power of music to connect people and bind them to a cause. Finally, we meet Toshi, his wife of nearly sixty years, and members of his family, at the house he built on a mountainside in upstate New York.<br><br><i>The Protest Singer</i> is as spirited and captivating as its subject&#x2014;an American icon, celebrating his ninetieth birthday.</p><p>Alec Wilkinson began writing for <i>The New Yorker </i>in 1980. Before that, he was a policeman<i> </i>in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, and before that a rock-and-roll musician.<i> </i>He has published eight other books&#x2014;two memoirs,<i> </i>two collections of essays, two biographical portraits, and two pieces of reporting<i>. </i>His honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Lyndhurst Prize, and a Robert F. Kennedy Book Award. He lives with his wife and son in New York City.SEEGER&#x2019;S POLITICS are of the most extravagantly conservative kind. He believes ardently in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. His interpretation of them is literal. In his years of activism, through the movements for workers&#x2019; rights, civil rights, the movement against the Vietnam War, and the ecological movement, in all of which he figured prominently, there is no conceit that he has more emphatically embraced than that all human beings are created equal and have equal rights. In the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, such a conviction made a person not a patriot, but a socialist. When Seeger moved to Beacon, in 1949, he held a couple of meetings with a middle- age couple, the only other Communists around, then quit the party. &#x201c;I thought it was pointless,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I realized I could sing the same songs I sang whether I belonged to the Communist Party or not, and I never liked the idea anyway of belonging to a secret organization.&#x201d;<br><br>After lunch we went out and looked at the river, and I could see where Seeger had been standing, in 1955, when a car arrived, and the man driving it asked if he was Pete Seeger. Then he handed Seeger an envelope and left. Seeger opened the envelope and called out to Toshi, &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve finally got around to me.&#x201d; He had been summoned to testify before the House Un- American Activities Committee, in August.<br><br>Toshi found a lawyer who told Seeger that the option most commonly invoked was to cite the Fifth Amendment, which would lead to the case&#x2019;s being dismissed. Seeger didn&#x2019;t care for the inference of guilt that the gesture implied. People who had done so were sometimes described as &#x201c;Fifth Amendment Communists.&#x201d; The lawyer also said that Seeger could choose to talk about himself to the committee but refuse to talk about other people. &#x201c;I had known I could do that,&#x201d; Seeger told me, &#x201c;because my father, in 1952, I think it was, had to resign his job inWashington when the FBI came and spoke to him, and he said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m willing to undress myself in a sentence, but I&#x2019;m not going to tell about anyone else I know.&#x2019; They said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got to tell about everyone.&#x2019; He said he wasn&#x2019;t willing to do that. He knew he would be fired, so he walked in the next morning and resigned. He was head of the music department of the Pan American Union. He&#x2019;d hoped to hang on for a few years, since he hadn&#x2019;t the savings, but he closed down his house&#x2014;a great big house that he&#x2019;d raised four kids in&#x2014;and his wife had just died a few months earlier, and my sister was going to Radcliffe, so he went up and got a crowded little apartment in Cambridge. Anyway, the lawyer told me if, at the hearing, I answered the question, &#x2018;Are you a member of the Communist Party?&#x2019; the next question would be, &#x2018;Who did you know?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The third choice was to rely on the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and &#x201c;the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#x201d; The Hollywood Ten, a group of screenwriters and producers, had tried this in 1947, and been convicted of contempt, jailed for a year, and then blacklisted. Employing this tactic, Seeger might spend years in court, have his career ruined, and still go to jail. The lawyer left the choice to Seeger. He told him not to bait the committee, to be polite, to answer their questions, or say why he wouldn&#x2019;t. Refusing to answer would result in a contempt citation, and each citation could be worth a year in jail. As the hearing approached, the lawyer reviewed with Seeger the questions he was likely to be asked.<br><br>Seeger appeared before the committee, in New York, on August 18, 1955. He was interrogated by Walter Tavenner, the committee counsel; Representative Francis Walter, the chairman; Gordon Scherer, a congressman from Ohio and a former prosecutor; and Edwin Willis, a congressman from Louisiana. &#x201c;They were small- town politicians,&#x201d; Seeger said. &#x201c;Walter was a lawyer from the coal country.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeger wore a tweed jacket, a plaid shirt, a yellow tie, and dark pants. Toshi sat in the audience, with his banjo. The men asked what Seeger did for a living. Student of American folklore, he said, but he made his living as &#x201c;a banjo picker.&#x201d; Before going into the Army, had he practiced his profession?<br><br>&#x201c;It is hard to call it a profession,&#x201d; Seeger said. &#x201c;I kind of drifted into it and I never intended to be a musician, and I am glad I am one now, and it is a very honorable profession, but when I started out actually I wanted to be a newspaperman, and when I left school&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you answer the question, please?&#x201d; Tavenner asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to explain that it really wasn&#x2019;t my profession,&#x201d; Seeger said. &#x201c;I picked up a little change in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you practice your profession?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sang for people, yes, before World War II, and I also did as early as 1925.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And upon your return from the service in December of 1945, you continued in your profession?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I continued singing, and I expect I always will,&#x201d; Seeger said.<br><br>Tavenner was maneuvering Seeger toward admitting that he had sung for the Communist Party. Then he would ask him to name all the other people who had done the same thing or to name people who had listened to him. He referred to an announcement in the Daily Worker from 1947 which read, &#x201c;Tonight&#x2014; Bronx, hear Peter Seeger and his guitar, at Allerton Section housewarming.&#x201d; Was the Allerton Section a section of the Communist Party, Tavenner asked?<br><br>Seeger refused to answer. When pressed, he said, &#x201c;I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this. I would be very glad to tell you my life if you want to hear of it.&#x201d;<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t. Tavenner asked instead if Seeger had performed at a May Day Rally in 1948.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe I have already answered this question, and the same answer,&#x201d; Seeger said.<br><br>Walter asked what that answer was.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel that in my whole life I have never done anything of any conspiratorial nature,&#x201d; Seeger said, &#x201c;and I resent very much and very deeply the implication of being called before this committee that in some way because my opinions may be different from yours, or yours, Mr. Willis, or yours, Mr. Scherer, that I am any less of an American than anybody else. I love my country very deeply, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you make a little contribution toward preserving its institutions?&#x201d; Walter asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel that my whole life is a contribution,&#x201d; Seeger said. &#x201c;That is why I would like to tell you about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hear about it,&#x201d; Walter said.<br><br>Scherer asked that Seeger be directed to answer, a formality. Each time a witness was directed to answer and didn&#x2019;t, he was regarded as being in contempt. Seeger said he had already answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me understand,&#x201d; Scherer said. &#x201c;You are not relying on the Fifth Amendment, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; Seeger said, &#x201c;although I do not want to in any way discredit or depreciate or depredate the witnesses that have used the Fifth Amendment, and I simply feel it is improper for this committee to ask such questions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then in answering the rest of the questions,&#x201d; Scherer said, &#x201c;or in refusing to answer the rest of the questions, I understand that you are not relying on the Fifth Amendment as a basis for your refusal to answer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I am not, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Tavenner continued to ask about events where Seeger was said to have taken part.

The Spanish adventurers, however, were quickly driven away by the Timucua people; further landings were similarly defeated by the powerful archery fire of the Calusa, who ultimately took the lives of Hernandez de Cordoba and Ponce de Leon himself. Clearly, the European experience in North America would be a far cry from their swift victories over the Aztecs and Incas.<br> In <em>Warpaths</em>, Ian K. Steele provides a sweeping history of the numerous European invasions of North America, painting a dramatic new portrait of the centuries of warfare that shook the continent. Steele's fascinating account destroys the old image of technologically advanced Europeans overrunning primitive savages. Instead, he reveals how Amerindians rose to the challenge of each successive invasion with martial and diplomatic skill, from the defeat of Ponce de Leon in 1513 to a negotiated peace with the British in 1765. In war after war, the Amerindians and Europeans battled in a precarious balance, adapting each other's technology and tactics and seeking each other out as supply sources for food and weapons. Steele follows the experience of the Spanish at San Agust�n, the English at Jamestown and Plymouth, the French at Qu�bec, and the Dutch at Albany, revealing the vast range of Amerindian strategies for coping with the invaders. For a century and a half, for example, Amerindians repelled the Spanish in Florida; the Powhatan fought the English at Jamestown for just as long. The Algonquin and Huron skillfully drew the French into their wars with the Mohawk, while the Wampanoag reach an accommodation with the Pilgrims that lasted for fifty years. Throughout the era, the Amerindians shrewdly played on European rivalries; indeed, they faced the greatest danger when the European courts declared peace between their colonies. The Five Nations, Creek, and Cherokee confederations in particular used the Europeans to extend their own power. Steele continues the story through the arrival of European regulars in 1755, showing how the Amerindians adapted to the resulting changes in warfare and the ultimate British victory over the French. In the end, the triumphant English were faced with a powerful Amerindian campaign against their outlying posts that forced them to accept a military stalemate on the frontier, leading to a negotiated balance of power in 1765.<br> The conflicts that erupted with the European arrival have long been encrusted with myth and self-congratulatory folklore. <em>Warpaths</em> offers a startling new look at this pivotal era, combining social, cultural, and military history to provide a more nuanced portrait of the violence that gave birth to modern North America.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Ian K. Steele</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Western Ontario. His books include <em>Betrayals: Fort William Henry and the "Massacre"</em> and <em>The English Atlantic, 1675-1740</em>.<br>Examining the response of Native Americans to European encroachment is hardly virgin territory. Nevertheless, Steele provides a fresh perspective in analyzing Native American/European conflicts from the sixteenth century to the close of the French and Indian War in 1763. Steele rejects the current tendency to portray Native Americans as confused, doomed victims who were inevitably overwhelmed by a more aggressive and technologically advanced culture. Rather, the indigenous peoples of the eastern woodlands were themselves often quite aggressive. They were diverse and politically sophisticated and frequently gave as good as they got in conflicts with Europeans. Many tribes became experts at playing the French and English off against each other. Steele pays full tribute to the cultural strengths of those tribes without sentimentalizing them, and he avoids demonizing Europeans. He has provided a valuable and original view of a cultural and military conflict that has been so instrumental in shaping our national character. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p><h2>Destination Unknown</h2><p><p>Agatha Christie's genius for detective fiction is unparalleled.

Jakkin and Akki, whom readers met in the two preceeding volumes, have survived in the Austarian wilds through bonding with the dragon Heart's Blood, and in this volume continue their harrowing journey to freedom and spiritual enlightenment. Like the two volumes preceeding it, A Sending of Dragons ' particular strengths are in the almost encyclopedic detail which Yolen has lavished upon her fully realized alternative world of Austar IV, in her sympathetic portrayal of the dragons as both victims and telepathic partners, and in the symbolic sub-text which enriches her narrative and reinforces her universal theme of the inter-dependency and unique value of all life forms. Similarly the shortcomings reflect those of the two companion volumes: these include certain stylistic shortcomings and a tendency toward one-dimensional characterization. Nevertheless the trilogy remains an ambitious and rewarding work of speculative fiction. The two previous volumes should be read for a more complete understanding and appreciation of this concluding volume.

The author&#39;s other books include &#34;The Old Devils&#34;, which won the 1986 Booker Prize.</p><p>Although Kingsley Amis's acid satire of postwar British academic life has lost some of its bite in the four decades since it was published, it's still a rewarding read. And there's no denying how big an impact it had back then--<i>Lucky Jim</i> could be considered the first shot in the Oxbridge salvo that brought us <i>Beyond the Fringe</i>, <i>That Was the Week That Was</i>, and so much more. <p> In <i>Lucky Jim</i>, Amis introduces us to Jim Dixon, a junior lecturer at a British college who spends his days fending off the legions of malevolent twits that populate the school. His job is in constant danger, often for good reason. <i>Lucky Jim</i> hits the heights whenever Dixon tries to keep a preposterous situation from spinning out of control, which is every three pages or so. The final example of this--a lecture spewed by a hideously pickled Dixon--is a chapter's worth of comic nirvana. The book is not politically correct (Amis wasn't either), but take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed.</p>Kingsley Amis&#39; (1922-1995) works take a humorous yet highly critical look at British society, especially of the period following the end of World War II. He was born in London. Amis explored his disillusionment with British society in novels such asTHAT UNCERTAIN FEELING (1955). His other works include THE GREEN MAN (1970); STANLEY AND THE WOMEN (1984); and THE OLD DEVILS (1986) which won the Booker Prize.

Zappa endured a peripatetic youth and an early brush with the law that fueled his trademark anti-authoritarian strain; his musical brilliance eventually transformed him from class clown into one of rock's major icons, with such landmark records as <i>We're Only in It for the Money </i>and<i> Joe's Garage.</i> Miles skillfully weaves together the major beats and minor notes of Zappa's remarkable life, no small feat given the musician's many contradictions: he was a hard-rocking star, but also a meticulous, studious composer influenced by Var�se and Stravinsky; he despised drug use and the trappings of stardom, but he loved groupies (he partook of their favors freely, eventually marrying one and fathering...children). A virtuoso, a perfectionist and a shrewd businessman, Zappa alienated, sued or otherwise offended nearly everyone in his life at some point; he especially loved tormenting his audience. Miles hits the ups and downs of Zappa's life like a skilled composer in his own right, and he captures the contentious eras (from the late 1950s on) in which Zappa's genius emerged. The result is a penetrating look both at Zappa and at the social and political milieu in which popular rock music stepped to the fore. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After 33 years on the river, Clemens and his crew--including the giant subhuman Joe Miller--are finally near the end of their journey, and only one obstacle remains: the evil Earthly king, John Lackland. John is waiting just upriver in the <i>Rex Grandissimus</i>, the first riverboat that Sam constructed and the one that John and his crew hijacked, and he's hell-bent on sinking Sam's boat (and vice versa). Complicating the battle is the fact that both ships likely contain agents of the Ethicals, the group of advanced beings who created Riverworld for reasons unknown. One or more of the Ethicals themselves may even be on board, as are various humans that the rebel Ethical, known as the Mysterious Stranger (but known to Clemens simply as X), enlisted in his cause, which may or may not lead to humanity's salvation.<p> The battle is set to take place along the shores populated by members of the Church of the Second Chance, a group that believes they must attain ethical perfection in order to proceed to the next phase of existence. The Second Chancers are not violent, but their charismatic leader, La Viro, may attempt to sink one or both of the iron ships in order to prevent the battle. Among the Second Chancers is former Nazi officer Hermann Goring, who had a run-in with Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, <i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i>. Burton and his companions--among them several people who were contacted by the Mysterious Stranger--are reluctantly serving on John's boat in order to reach the headwaters of the river. But will any of the humans working for X survive the coming battle? And if so, how can they possibly hope to penetrate the tower in the North Sea where the Ethicals are thought to reside? And what could lowly humans hope to do against a race so advanced that they can reshape entire planets and resurrect all of humanity? <i>--Craig E.

The author has a passion for lace and the Victorian women who pioneered the first published knitting patterns. There are 40 patterns in the book for beautiful lace shawls and scarves that have been inspired or recreated from these vintage patterns. The book begins with a brief exploration of Victorian knitting books and chapters based on the patterns several nineteenth century tomes. The patterns provided are for a variety of levels from the enthusiastic first-time knitter to the experienced with simple but effective starter projects to the mind-bogglingly challenging. There are clear explanation and charts to accompany each one and there is a full technique library which covers a variety of cast-ons, stitch manoeuvres and borders. The entire book is sumptuously photographed with a fascinating chapter on Jane&#39;s researches and production of Victorian Lace Today. If you have ever been remotely tempted to try lace then this book is an excellent companion; the author describes herself as a &#39;normal&#39; knitter before embarking on her research and with &#34;curiosity and determination&#34; has created this beautiful collection of lace shawls you see in the book. * Knit Today * Jan 07 A decade in the making, this elegant book harks back to the 1800s, when knitting for pleasure took wing and the first wave of knitting authors made a name for itself. Those pioneers - Misses Watts, Hope and Lambert, Mrs Gaugain - are revered and revitalized by Sowerby, who updates their gorgeous designs, along with those in the &#39;Weldon&#39;s Practical Knitter&#39; volumes, to work with today&#39;s fibers and sensibilities. Shot on grand location at the English estate used in the BBC&#39;s Pride and Prejudice, as well as on the bridges of Cambridge and at stately museums, the photos byn Alexis Xenakis do complete justice to the beauty and intricacy of the lace. If you&#39;re a lace knitter, get one copy for the coffee table and another to dog-ear your way through. * Yarn Market News * Feb 08 Did you know that Queen Victoria was a keen knitter? Have you ever wanted to knit a 150-year-old pattern but now known where to start? This excellent book addresses both questions, tracing the history of how lace-making evolved from the 1830s to the 1900s and updating Victorian patterns for the modern knitter. As part of her research on the subject, author Jane Sowerby has gathered together many original Victorian patterns, and then given them a clever modern update by adapting them for today&#39;s yarns and colours. The result is a very successful collection which includes flowing shawls and delicate scarves as well as some more unusual designs. It also caters to all skill levels, so even if you&#39;re new to lace you&#39;ll find something simple and stunning to start on. This book is also beautiful to look at and includes many great location shots taken in and around Cambridge. The gorgeous photos show off Jane&#39;s designs against some wonderful backdrops. The stunning design of the book itself combined with the wealth of historical details and the gorgeous patterns makes this an ideal coffee table book for the keen knitter. It would also make an excellent gift for a special knitting friend - we&#39;re adding to to our wish lists! * Simply Knitting * Jan 07 A decade in the making, this elegant book harks back to the 1800s, when knitting for pleasure took wing and the first wave of knitting authors made a name for itself.

It might even be described as a photographer&#39;s ego trip, were the photographer not Alexis Xenakis, the editor of Knitter&#39;s magazine and a man with a lot of experience of illustrating knitting. As an American he seems simply to be revelling in the UK&#39;s architectural heritage whilst on a trip to illustrate Jane Sowerby&#39;s amazing collection of knitted lace and her research into Victorian lace knitters and designer. For me though, that is the problem with a book that I shall no doubt buy, but which I find is set out in a way that I do not immediately follow. Yes, each pattern has a schematic of the finished shape, details of the tension, the materials (in generic yarn type as well as commercial brands) and charted stitch patterns and the instructions are written out at the start. Despite this information, there is nothing that shows where each of the charts appears on the final version. I would have liked something like &#39;the body of this triangular shawl is worked from the point to the wide edge and the border is then added to all three sides&#39;. I also found the habit of putting some quotes from Victorian authors in quotation marks but others indented and in an italic font (the book uses a sans serif font so that italic type does not show up very clearly) irritating. But perhaps the greatest omission in a work that contains so much research is the lack of an index to anything but the projects and the photographic locations. There is no bibliography either. However, as a visual delight, this book is at least the equal of any other knitting book that I have ever seen and it stands alone because of the historical research and enormous collection of beautifully knitted and immaculately presented knitting.

His major contention is that, in a system where most judges are white and most defendants black, judges are "ignorant of and indifferent to the debased reality of those who are judged." The book, a hodgepodge of autobiographical experiences and reflections, is so poorly organized that Wright never fully develops his argument. Instead, he offers random accounts of painful racial episodes that he has experienced or observed in the courtroom and elsewhere. Topics range from relations between blacks and Jews, to conflicts with New York City police over his lenient bail policies. Recalling his days as a young lawyer with the "naive ideal" that he could help blacks, Wright is pessimistic and half-hearted in suggesting that better education of potential judges in racial aspects of U.S. history might improve the situation depicted here. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Color in Contemporary Painting: Integrating Practice and Theory</h2><p>Explains how to make use of colour in oil, acrylic and watercolour painting. Colour theories are outlined, but the main emphasis is on the way contemporary artists actually use colour. The book&#39;s thesis is that once artists have become acquainted with fundamental colour principles, they can begin to have fun with colour and play with it spontaneously. A number of approaches to colour are set forth as a guide, including building a picture with colour blocks, enriching colour with shadows, heightening colour intensity, achieving freshness with broken colour, painting with sunlight, experimenting with abstract colour systems, fantasizing with colour and creating space with colour. Each of the sections of this book are illustrated by the work of artists of historical importance as well as by the work of contemporary artists. There are also a number of development studies of the author&#39;s own work. Each section closes with a group of suggested exercises.

McIntyre has spent more than half a century in South America; he has served as military adviser in Peru, worked in a foreign aid program in Bolivia and reported for National Geographic and Geo. In years of travel in the Amazon basin, he lived with remote Indian tribes and, in 1971, discovered the source of the Amazon River. Though his dazzling photographs here command attention, the narrative is a worthy complement remarkably comprehensive for its brevity and offering information on history, exploration and exploitation. McIntyre organizes his material around the river system: white water from the western Andean slopes, black water from the Rio Negro and its tributaries in the north, blue water from the south and central Brazilian highlands and the brown mainstream. The photographs show spectacular aerial views, cloud- and fog-shrouded landscapes, native peoples and wildlife. In an epilogue, the author also discusses the future of Amazonia--"Treasure Chest or Pandora's Box." Photos. 20,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Sierra Club imprint has come to stand for superbly illustrated, well-written books, and this is no exception. The author has traveled widely in the Amazon region and is obviously fascinated by it. He knows its history, both human and natural, and respects its inhabitants, not as anthropological curiosities, but as people. From the upper reaches of the Amazon, based in the Andes, to the estuary thousands of miles away in the Atlantic, he follows its course and the course of its tributaries with dazzling photography and cogent comment. The last chapter "Amazonia: Treasure Chest or Pandora's Box?" is a microcosmic summary in one area--Rondonia--of the struggle of developing nations to progress economically versus the environmentalists, mostly whites from developed countries, to maintain Amazonia as it is.

But the lucid prose of the original suffered the same hardening of the linguistic arteries that overtook the King James Version of the Bible. <p>In this edition, antique and obscure words and sentence structure have been eliminated and references to people and matters of faith come alive through the annotations. The nature of the church, its ministry and sacraments, and the relationship of church and state, with the consequent implications for religious liberty and Christian integrity, are key topics. </p><p>If you are a Quaker seeking a better understanding of your own faith, or an ecumenist trying to understand beliefs that were significant to Methodism, challenging to Calvinism, and frequently in rapport with Catholicism, you will find Barclay's Apology enlightening.</p></p><p>Robert Barclay (1648-1690) is best known as the author of the classic systematic statement of Quaker faith--An Apology for the True Christian Divinity.</p><h2>The Last Nazi: The Life and Times of Dr. Joseph Mengele</h2><p>The definitive investigation into the life and unspeakable crimes of the Nazi &#34;Angel of Death&#34; explores how he rose to power in the Third Reich and how he evaded capture since World War II</p><p>Now that Mengele's remains have been exhumed and identified, we can expect a number of popular biographies. Astor spent several years preparing this loosely documented study. As to the ``Angel of Death's'' motives and inner psyche, the author has few thoughtful answers. The Auschwitz chapters are predictably shocking and melodramatic; it is only when Astor focuses on Mengele's decades of evasion in South America that the story becomes taut and meaningful. For it is only then that the aging and impenitent Nazi achieves those human qualities that make him seem plausible and understandable.

And the issues were many: the revolution in class structure and class attitudes; the rise of utilitarianism and the evangelical spirit; the crisis in religion, including the Oxford movement and Darwinism; the democratization of culture; the place of art and the artist in an industrial, bourgeois society; the effects of industrialism, especially on the way people live.

Lazarus needs to find someone in St. Giles, and he believes Temperance can help him because the foundling home is located in a crime-riddled London neighborhood, and she knows nearly everyone. In exchange, Lazarus will give her the temporary funds she needs, and introduce her to the wealthiest members of society. It was a simple business transaction, but Temperance and Lazarus quickly find themselves distracted by his and her new &#x201c;partner.&#x201d; With a dash of sharp wit; a rare literary flair for creating complex, compelling characters; and lively writing that packs a powerful emotional punch, Hoyt delivers the first sensually charged, danger-infused installment in a new Georgian-set series. --John Charles</p><h2>Wild Abundance: Ritual, Revelry &amp; Recipes of the South's Finest Hunting Clubs</h2><p><p> <i>Wild Abundance </i>is a coffee table book with 250 stunning photographs celebrating the stories, spirit and traditions of Southern hunting clubs. It features over 70 recipes, appealing to camp cooks and home cooks alike. Through the voices of nine renowned chefs, <i>Wild Abundance</i> honors and documents the contribution of often-untrained cooks who create traditions and are important parts of the vitality of each club.</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p> It was so gratifying that these chefs put their time, energy, hearts and souls into this project. I was touched by their passion and their heartfelt commitment to pay tribute to the unsung cooks in the camps who are keeping an important culinary&nbsp;tradition alive. <br> &nbsp; The owners&nbsp;who opened these private clubs to us offered a rare glimpse into this world.&nbsp;They are all avid conservationists and devoted to preserving and caring for the land so that future generations can enjoy the fruits of the land. <p>&nbsp;</p> Next time someone bemoans that they can&#x2019;t think of anything to get a man or a hunter in their lives, I&#x2019;ve got the perfect solution. In my travels, I&#x2019;ve already heard from people who bought our first book, First Shooting Light, as a wedding gift or housewarming gift and can&#x2019;t wait to give Wild Abundance. It&#x2019;s the perfect coffee table book to showcase the soul and spirit of the South. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p>&#x201c;<i>Wild Abundance</i> captures the time-honored Southern hunting camp experience in stunning photographs and moving descriptions by some of my very favorite chefs. I was immediately reminded of the tales my grandfather told of his duck hunting exploits, and I can still taste the magic his cook worked with the bounty he brought home. Happily, there is also plenty of magic on these pages. This book is a real gift to anyone who loves the South and its traditions and, above all, good food.&#x201d;JULIA REED<br> Author of <i>The House on First Street</i> and <i>Ham Biscuits, Hostess Gowns, and Other Southern Specialties</i>&#x201c;Fighting Bayou is the best place in the world for unbelievable duck hunting, fabulous Southern cooking and listening to great stories from true characters. I always cherish my time at this special place.&#x201d;ELI MANNING&#x201c;In wonderful photography and delicious recipes, <i>Wild Abundance</i> offers a rare glimpse into one of the nation&#x2019;s hidden worlds, the South&#x2019;s venerable hunting clubs where time has stood still, where the primordial face-off between humans and nature continues and where the cooking remains some of the finest to be found.&#x201d;MOLLY O&#x2019;NEILL<br> Author of <i>One Big Table: A Portrait of American Cooking</i>&#x201c;Along with visions of some of my Southern chef friends having the time of their lives, the spirit of the South is what lives on in the timeless anthology <i>Wild Abundance</i>. The winter bird hunt, a Southern rite of passage, is usually a private time with close friends and family &#x2013; coming together to break bread and share in the ancient ritual of hunting for sustenance. While plenty of strong drink brings out a Roman feasting element, all is bound by a Southern sense of hospitality and gracious sharing. It brings an almost spiritual side to the predawn winter night &#x2013; freezing cold, nervous with anticipation &#x2013; all captured on these glorious pages with chefs, camp cooks and good buddies. I wish I were there. Well, next winter, let&#x2019;s go.

So successful has this propaganda campaign been that Palestinian spinmeisters and their apologists have effectively declared the Israelis, a people living in the shadow of the Holocaust, to be &#34;Nazis.&#34; How could this happen? How did unacceptable anti-Semitism morph into justifiable anti-Zionism, and odious Jew-hatred turn into a politically correct Israel-hatred? In History Upside Down, David Meir-Levi exposes the ideological DNA of Palestinian nationalism and its ludicrous &#34;alternative&#34; histories, revealing how Nazi fascism gave the Arab world&#39;s amorphous hatred of the Jews an intellectual structure and how Soviet communism masked its genocidal intentions with the mantle of national liberation. Meir-Levi then explodes the cornerstone myths that the Palestinian movement created--myths that rationalize and celebrate decades of unremitting terror and genocidal ambitions, turning the history of the Middle East upside down and inside out, making the victim the aggressor and the aggressor the victim. History Upside Down is the first wave in a counterattack against this Arab war on history. It rejects the idea that the basic situation in the Middle East has changed since the United Nations first established the Jewish state and the Palestinian state that would have stood alongside it. Sadly, argues Meir-Levi, the issue in the Middle East is today what it has been since the Muslim invasion in the seventh century: the Arabs&#39; hatred of the Jews.</p><p>David Meir-Levi is an American-born Israeli currently living in Palo Alto, California. He taught archaeology and Near Eastern history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and at the University of Tel Aviv, and served in the Israeli military. He now teaches Middle Eastern history at San Jose State University. A senior project manager at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, Mr. Meir-Levi writes extensively on Middle East issues for Front Page Magazine and other online journals, and also hosts radio and TV programs analyzing the Middle East conflict.David Meir-Levi's "brief encounter" offers a solid approach to understanding the basics of the Arab-Israeli conflict, arguably the world's most persistent and polarized political issue. History Upside Down applies great common sense where demagogues and ignorami too often dominate. -- <i>Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum and author of Militant Islam Reaches America</i><br><br>In order for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to be resolved, the demonology will have to be taken out of it, and the historical and political facts allowed to speak for themselves dispassionately. David Meir-Levi shows how this can be done. -- <i>David Pryce-Jones, author of Betrayal: France, the Arabs, and the Jews</i></p><h2>Patternmaster</h2><p>The Patternist is a telepathic race, commanded by the Patternmaster, whose thoughts can destroy, heal, rule.

She is the winner of the Nebula Award and twice winner of the Hugo Award.</p><h2>The Rescue Artist: An Edgar Award Winner</h2><p><p>In the predawn gloom of a February day in 1994, two thieves entered the National Gallery in Oslo. They snatched one of the world's most famous paintings, Edvard Munch's <em>The Scream</em>, and fled with their $72 million trophy. The thieves made sure the world was watching: the Winter Olympics, in Lillehammer, began that same morning. Baffled and humiliated, the Norwegian police called on the world's greatest art detective, a half-English, half-American undercover cop named Charley Hill.</p><p>In this rollicking narrative, <strong>Edward Dolnick</strong> takes us inside the art underworld. The trail leads high and low, and the cast ranges from titled aristocrats to thick-necked thugs. Lord Bath, resplendent in ponytail and velvet jacket, presides over a 9,000-acre estate. David Duddin, a 300-pound fence who once tried to sell a stolen Rembrandt, spins exuberant tales of his misdeeds. We meet Munch, too, a haunted misfit who spends his evenings drinking in the Black Piglet Caf� and his nights feverishly trying to capture in paint the visions in his head. The most compelling character of all is Charley Hill, an ex-soldier, a would-be priest, and a complicated mix of brilliance, foolhardiness, and charm. The hunt for <em>The Scream</em> will either cap his career and rescue one of the world's best-known paintings or end in a fiasco that will dog him forever.</p></p><p><p>Edward Dolnick is the author of <em>Down the Great Unknown</em>, <em>The Forger&#x2019;s Spell</em>, and the Edgar Award-winning <em>The Rescue Artist</em>. A former chief science writer at the <em>Boston Globe</em>, he lives with his wife near Washington, D.C. </p>The little-known world of art theft is compellingly portrayed in Dolnick's account of the 1994 theft and recovery of Edvard Munch's iconic painting <i>The Scream.</i> The theft was carried out with almost comical ease at Norway's National Gallery in Oslo on the very morning that the Winter Olympics began in that city. Despite the low-tech nature of the crime, the local police were baffled, and Dolnick (<i>Down the Great Unknown</i>;<i> Madness on the Couch</i>) makes a convincing case that the fortunate resolution of the investigation was almost exclusively due to the expertise, ingenuity and daring of the "rescue artist" of the title: Charley Hill, a Scotland Yard undercover officer and former Fulbright scholar who has made recovering stolen art treasures his life's work. Hill is a larger-than-life figure who seems lifted from the pages of Elmore Leonard, although his adversaries in this inquiry are fairly pedestrian. While the path to the painting's retrieval is relatively straightforward once some shady characters put the word out that they can get their hands on it, the narrative's frequent detours to other crimes and engaging escapades from Hill's past elevate this work above last year's similar <i>The Irish Game</i> by Matthew Hart. 16 pages of b&amp;w and 8 pages of color photos not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lorna remembers seeing not just the world around her but seeing equally vividly angels and spirits. For many years she assumed everyone saw the same. </p> <p>As Lorna tells the story of her life, growing up in a poor family, later working in Dublin, marrying and experiencing family tragedy, the reader meets, as she did, the creatures from the spirit worlds who also inhabit our own - mostly angels of an astonishing beauty and variety � including the prophet Elijah and an Archangel- but also the spirits of people who have died. </p> <p>Today, it is not only the sick and troubled who come to visit Lorna, looking for healing and consolation, but theologians of different faiths and the head of a religious order in Rome are asking her for guidance too. </p> <p>This remarkable document is the testimony of a woman who sees things at the far end of the spectrum, beyond the range of our everyday experience.</p>Lorna Byrne has been seeing and talking to angels since she was a baby. Now, having raised her family, she talks openly for the first time about what she has seen and learned. She lives quietly in rural Ireland.</p><h2>Degas and the Dance</h2><p>Seeks to illuminate the themes present in the artist&#39;s works, presenting new material about his highly informed relationship with the ballet of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Jill DeVoynar is an independent curator and a former ballet dancer who continues to teach ballet. Richard Kendall, an art historian and independent curator, is a recognized authority on Degas and Impressionism. Both authors live in Nyack, NY.Edgar Degas' fascination with the ballet is legendary. What is less well known, and what this beautifully illustrated volume shows so well, is that many of his works are the result of an intimate link with the Paris Opera. Kendall, an art historian and recognized authority on Degas, and DeVonyar, an independent curator and former dancer, have taken the myths that have grown up around Degas' paintings and career and attempted to replace them with factual sources for his work. Degas' personal knowledge of the dancers, understanding of the dance and its techniques, connection with both the old and new opera houses, and free access to rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms, and other backstage areas are explored in detail in a successful effort to understand how he came to portray the ballet as intimately as he did. Books about Degas abound. What makes this one fresh and unique is its inclusion of early and little-known sketches, and focus on how and why Degas came to prefer depicting backstage reality rather than dance itself. <i>Lauren Roberts</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It&#x2019;s totally sick.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Help,</i> I thought as my brother held up his prized possession, a tablet, for the gazillionth time. Not another lame clip on YouTube!<br> <br>It was the last thing I wanted to look at as we sat inside the swanky Peyton mansion. I wanted to check out the two slick cabin cruisers docked outside the bay window!<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you give us a break already, Joe?&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ve seen enough skateboarding squirrels and break-dancing babies to last a lifetime.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our friend Chet Morton cracked a smile. &#x201c;Yeah, but those rapping sock puppets you showed us before were pretty sick,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;Got any more of those?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe shook his head. &#x201c;Check it out&#x2014;it&#x2019;s serious stuff,&#x201d; he said, practically shoving the tablet in our faces.<br> <br>&#x201c;You, serious?&#x201d; I joked. &#x201c;Since when?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe knew what I meant. Our ages were only one year apart, but our personalities&#x2014;worlds apart. Joe was always high-strung, fast-talking, and unpredictable. Me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m more the strong, silent type. At least that&#x2019;s what I like to think.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you look at the clip already?&#x201d; Joe urged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep it on pause forever.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t put down that fancy new tablet since he got it for his birthday. I couldn&#x2019;t really blame him. We couldn&#x2019;t have smartphones until we were in college, so the tablet was the next best thing. It surfed the Web, got e-mails&#x2014;even took pictures and videos. Speaking of videos . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;But if I see one squirrel or sock puppet&#x2014;it&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet and I leaned forward to watch the clip. There were no skateboarding squirrels or sock puppets&#x2014;just a clerk at a fast-food take-out window, handing a paper bag to a customer. The clerk looked about sixteen or seventeen. The person behind the wheel had his back to the camera, which was probably being held by someone in the passenger seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bor-ing!&#x201d; Chet sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, here it comes,&#x201d; Joe said. He turned up the volume just as the clerk said, &#x201c;Six dollars and seventy cents, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>The driver reached out to pay. But then he yanked the lid off his jumbo cup and hurled what looked like a slushie all over the kid at the take-out window!<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep the change!&#x201d; the driver cackled before zooming off. I could hear another voice snickering&#x2014;probably the creep filming the whole thing.<br> <br>I stared at the screen. &#x201c;Definitely not cool,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And a perfectly good waste of a jumbo slushie,&#x201d; Chet joked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not funny, Chet,&#x201d; Joe said with a frown.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you find that clip, Joe?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lonny, a guy in my math class, forwarded it to me,&#x201d; Joe explained. &#x201c;Lonny was the poor clerk who got slushied.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did they ever find the guys who did it?&#x201d; Chet asked.<br> <br>Joe shook his head and said, &#x201c;The burger place called the cops, but so far the slushie slinger&#x2019;s still on the loose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s a&#x2014;cold case?&#x201d; Chet joked. &#x201c;Cold . . . slushie&#x2014;get it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s about as funny as those skateboarding squirrels, Morton,&#x201d; I complained. &#x201c;What we just saw was someone&#x2019;s idea of a dumb prank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but whose?&#x201d; Joe asked.<br> <br>This time Chet heaved a big sigh. &#x201c;Time out, you guys!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You promised your dad you were going to slow down the detective work, at least for now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Slow down?&#x201d; Joe asked. &#x201c;From something we&#x2019;ve been doing since we were seven and eight? Not a chance, bud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, what Joe didn&#x2019;t mention was that we were one wrong move away from reform school. No one knew about the Deal except our family, the police, and our former principal&#x2014;who had his own issues to deal with now!<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but a promise is a promise,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;So put that thing away already, Joe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before somebody comes in and sees it,&#x201d; Chet added.<br> <br>&#x201c;What would be so bad about that?&#x201d; Joe asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Chet said, smiling, &#x201c;surfing clips on YouTube isn&#x2019;t the thing to be doing in the parlor of one of the �ber-richest homes in Bayport.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glancing around the posh room we were sitting in, I knew Chet got the �ber-rich part right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Check out the pool table, you guys,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;As soon as I finish checking out those little beauties,&#x201d; Chet said, nodding toward a nearby table. On it was a silver platter filled with fancy frosted pastries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think of taking one,&#x201d; Joe said, pointing to a portrait hanging on the wall. &#x201c;Not while he&#x2019;s watching us.&#x201d;<br> <br>I studied the portrait in the heavy wooden frame. The subject was a middle-aged guy in a blue blazer and beige pants. His hair was dark, with streaks of gray, and he was holding a golf club. I figured he was Sanford T. Peyton, the owner of the house, the boats, and the pastries.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know much about him, just that when the multibillionaire dude wasn&#x2019;t living large in Bayport with his wife and daughter, he was opening hotels all over the country and maybe the world. The guy was crazy rich. And right now, crazy late!<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting in this room almost half an hour,&#x201d; I said as I glanced at the antique clock standing against the wall. &#x201c;Can someone please remind me why we&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gladly!&#x201d; Chet said. He stood up with a smug smile. &#x201c;My friends, we are about to be interviewed by Sanford T. Peyton for the honor of working the hottest party of the decade&#x2014;at least here in Bayport.&#x201d;<br> <br>With that, Chet turned to another portrait hanging on the opposite wall. This one showed a teenage girl with light brown hair, wearing a white sundress and holding a Cavalier King Charles spaniel with huge eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;His daughter Lindsay&#x2019;s Sweet Sixteen!&#x201d; Chet declared, pointing to the portrait with a flourish.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute,&#x201d; Joe said with a grin. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t mean the dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet and Joe were definitely psyched about this party. Too bad I couldn&#x2019;t say the same for myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys, we weren&#x2019;t good enough to be invited to Lindsay&#x2019;s Sweet Sixteen,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;So why should we work it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two words, my friend, two words,&#x201d; Chet said with a smile. &#x201c;Food and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Girls!&#x201d; Joe blurted out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it!&#x201d; I said with a smirk.<br> <br>The only thing I knew about Lindsay was that she didn&#x2019;t go to Bayport High with Chet, Joe, and me. Which was no surprise.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of the kids at this party will be from Bay Academy,&#x201d; I said, referring to the posh private school in Bayport. &#x201c;And you know what they&#x2019;re like. Total snobs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet cleared his throat loudly as the door swung open. Joe and I jumped up from our chairs as Sanford Peyton marched in, followed by his daughter, Lindsay. Walking briskly behind Lindsay was another girl of about the same age. She had long black hair, and her dark eyes were cast downward at her own tablet she was holding. As she glanced up, she threw me a quick smile. I caught myself smiling back.<br> <br><i>Hmm,</i> I thought, still smiling. <i>Maybe this job isn&#x2019;t such a bad idea.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Have a seat, boys,&#x201d; Sanford said as he sat behind his desk, facing us. Lindsay and the other girl stood behind Sanford, looking over his shoulders at us.<br> <br>As we sat back down, I could see Sanford studying the applications we&#x2019;d filled out.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see you all go to Bayport High,&#x201d; he said gruffly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy, they&#x2019;re cute, but not gladiator material,&#x201d; Lindsay cut in.<br> <br>The three of us stared at Lindsay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Say what?&#x201d; Joe said under his breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gladiators?&#x201d; Chet said. &#x201c;I thought you needed waiters. You know, to pass around the pigs in blankets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There will be no pigs in blankets at this party, boys,&#x201d; Sanford said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of a party has no pigs in blankets?&#x201d; Chet asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy.&#x201d; Lindsay sighed as she checked out her manicure. &#x201c;Just explain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sanford folded his hands on the desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;You see, boys,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the theme of Lindsay&#x2019;s Sweet Sixteen is No Place Like Rome. Four strong young men dressed as gladiators accompany Lindsay into the hall as she makes her grand entrance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean Empress Lindsay,&#x201d; Lindsay emphasized. &#x201c;And the gladiators will be carrying me on a throne designed just for the occasion.&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe, Chet, and I stared at Lindsay as she flipped her hair over her shoulder. Was she serious?<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it, I think,&#x201d; Joe said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll still need waiters, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For sure,&#x201d; Lindsay replied. She turned to the girl with the tablet and said, &#x201c;Sierra, make sure you get the music I want for my grand entrance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Hotter Than Vesuvius,&#x2019; &#x201d; Sierra said, tapping on her tablet. &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br> <br>So her name was Sierra. Nice name for a nice-looking girl. I watched Sierra busily taking notes until Sanford&#x2019;s voice interrupted my thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;If we do hire you as waiters,&#x201d; Sanford said, &#x201c;there&#x2019;ll be a dress code.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no problem, sir,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Joe and I own suits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, not suits,&#x201d; Sanford said. &#x201c;Togas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Togas?&#x201d; I repeated.<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean those sheets the guys in ancient Rome used to wrap themselves up in?&#x201d; Chet asked, wide-eyed.<br> <br>I glanced sideways at Joe, who didn&#x2019;t look too thrilled either. Was this Sweet Sixteen really worth it? But when I turned to look at Sierra, I got my answer. You bet!<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we can get togas,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or some white tablecloths from our mom,&#x201d; Joe added.<br> <br>Lindsay tapped her chin as she studied us one at a time. She pointed to me, then to Joe.<br> <br>&#x201c;Those two can be waiters,&#x201d; Lindsay said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just me and Frank?&#x201d; Joe asked, surprised. &#x201c;What about Chet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sanford didn&#x2019;t even look at Chet as he went on with the party details.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Sweet Sixteen will be held this Sunday night, being that the next day is a holiday,&#x201d; Sanford said. &#x201c;That gives us a whole day on Saturday to prepare food, the decorations&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My outfits!&#x201d; Lindsay cut in.<br> <br>I could see Chet making a time-out sign with his hands. &#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But what about me? Aren&#x2019;t I going to work this party too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Lindsay said. She turned to Sierra. &#x201c;Put that one on the B-list. We can always call him if we get desperate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;B-list?&#x201d; Chet muttered.<br> <br>Sanford looked at Joe and me and said, &#x201c;Well? Don&#x2019;t you want your job instructions?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced over at Chet, who looked like he&#x2019;d just been kicked in the stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thank you, sir,&#x201d; I said, standing up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s either all of us or none of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe stared at me before jumping up from his seat too. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come on, Chet, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you guys crazy?&#x201d; Lindsay cried as the three of us headed for the door. &#x201c;Do you realize how amazing this party will be? You never know who you might meet!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If the kids are anything like you,&#x201d; Joe mumbled, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re afraid of.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure whether Sierra or the Peytons had heard Joe, and I didn&#x2019;t want to find out. All I wanted to do was get out of that house ASAP!<br> <br>&#x201c;B-list,&#x201d; Chet kept repeating once we were outside. &#x201c;Why do you think Lindsay put me on the B-list?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>B</i> for &#x2018;bodacious,&#x2019; dude,&#x201d; Joe said, laughing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet cracked a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Forget about Princess Lindsay, Chet,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I heard Bay Academy kids can be snooty&#x2014;but that one takes the cake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wrong!&#x201d; Chet declared. He pulled a squished iced pastry from his jacket pocket. &#x201c;I took the cake&#x2014;on our way out!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, snap!&#x201d; Joe laughed.<br> <br>As we walked to my car, I had no trouble forgetting about Lindsay, but Sierra kept popping into my head. Then, as if Joe had read my mind . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw you watching that Sierra, Frank,&#x201d; he said with a grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;You never miss a beat, do you?&#x201d; I smirked.<br> <br>Joe shrugged and said, &#x201c;Just saying!&#x201d;<br> <br>Leaving the sprawling Peyton mansion behind us, we walked down the flagstone path toward the private parking lot. I could see my car in the distance right where I&#x2019;d parked it. But before we could get to my secondhand fuel-efficient sedan, we had to pass a parking lot full of luxury SUVs and sports cars.<br> <br>&#x201c;Boats and cars,&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;How many fancy toys can one family have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not enough if you&#x2019;re a Peyton,&#x201d; Chet said. &#x201c;Which ride do you think is Empress Lindsay&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe pointed to a red sports convertible whose vanity plate read LUV2SHOP. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a wild guess and say that one!&#x201d; he chuckled.<br> <br>Chet whistled through his teeth as we went to check out the shiny car. The top was down, so we got a good look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Black leather seating,&#x201d; I observed as the three of us walked slowly around the car. &#x201c;MP3 output . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, and I&#x2019;ll bet that&#x2019;s a heated steering wheel,&#x201d; Chet added.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not all it has, you guys,&#x201d; Joe called.<br> <br>Glancing up, I saw my brother staring at the car door. He didn&#x2019;t look impressed. Just dead serious.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Without saying a word, Joe pointed to the door. I turned to see what he was pointing at. That&#x2019;s when my jaw practically hit the ground&#x2014;because scratched across the gleaming red door were the angry words:<br> <br>RICH WITCH!</p><h2>The Circle Series: Black, Red, and White (The Circle Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b>More than a million fans have read The Circle Series.

But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata&#x2019;s past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler&#x2019;s terror threatens her life and family&#x2014;even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.<br><br>For Amadea, the convent is no refuge.

The sun was hot and the air still, and as she walked pensively behind them, the birds and insects were making a tremendous racket. Beata and her younger sister Brigitte had come to Geneva with their mother for the summer. Beata had just turned twenty, and her sister was three years younger. It had been thirteen months since the Great War had begun the previous summer, and this year her father had wanted them out of Germany for their holiday. It was late August 1915, and he had just spent a month there with them. Both of her brothers were in the army and had managed to get leave to join them for a week. Horst was twenty-three and a lieutenant at divisional headquarters in Munich. Ulm was a captain in the 105th Infantry Regiment, part of the Thirtieth Division, attached to the Fourth Army. He had just turned twenty-seven during the week he spent with them in Geneva.<br> <br> It had been nothing short of a miracle to get the entire family together. With the war seeming to devour all the young men in Germany, Beata worried constantly now about her brothers, as did their mother. Her father kept telling her that it would be over soon, but what Beata heard when she listened to her father and brothers talk was very different. The men were far more aware of the bleak times ahead than were the women. Her mother never spoke of the war to her, and Brigitte was far more upset that there were hardly any handsome young men to flirt with. Ever since she had been a little girl, all Brigitte had ever talked about was getting married. She had recently fallen in love with one of Horst's friends from university, and Beata had a strong suspicion that her beautiful younger sister would be getting engaged that winter.<br> <br> Beata had no such interests or intentions. She had always been the quiet one, studious and far more serious, and she was much more interested in her studies than in finding a young man. Her father always said she was the perfect daughter. Their only moment of dissent had been when she had insisted she wanted to go to university like her brothers, which her father said was foolish. Although he himself was serious and scholarly, he didn't think that that degree of education was necessary for a woman. He told her he felt sure that in a short time she would be married and tending to a husband and children. She didn't need to go to university, and he hadn't allowed it.<br> <br> Beata's brothers and their friends were a lively lot, and her sister was pretty and flirtatious. Beata had always felt different from them, set apart by her quiet ways and passion for education. In a perfect world, she would have loved to be a teacher, but when she said it, her siblings always laughed at her. Brigitte said that only poor girls became schoolteachers or governesses, and her brothers added that only ugly ones even thought about it. They loved to tease her, although Beata was neither poor nor ugly. Her father owned and ran one of the most important banks in Cologne, where they lived. They had a large handsome house in the Fitzengraben district, and her mother Monika was well known in Cologne, not only for her beauty but for her elegant clothes and jewelry. Like Beata, she was a quiet woman. Monika had married Jacob Wittgenstein when she was seventeen, and had been happy with him in the twenty-eight years since then.<br> <br> The marriage had been arranged by their respective families, and was a good one. At the time their union had been the merger of two considerable fortunes, and Jacob had enlarged theirs impressively since then. He ran the bank with an iron fist and was almost clairvoyant about the banking business. Not only was their future secure, but so were those of their heirs. Everything about the Wittgensteins was solid. The only unpredictable element in their life now was the same one worrying everyone these days. The war was a great concern to them, particularly to Monika, with two sons in the army. The time they had shared in Switzerland had been a comforting respite, for the parents as well as the children.<br> <br> Ordinarily, they spent their summers in Germany, at the seashore, but this year Jacob had wanted to get them all out of Germany for July and August. He had even spoken to one of the commanding generals whom he knew well, and gently asked the enormous favor of having both of his sons on leave and able to join them. The general had quietly arranged it. The Wittgensteins were that great rarity, a Jewish family that enjoyed not only great wealth but also enormous power. Beata was aware of it but paid little attention to her family's importance. She was far more interested in her studies. And although Brigitte sometimes fretted over the constraints their orthodoxy put on them, Beata, in her own quiet way, was deeply religious, which pleased her father. As a young man, he had shocked his own family by saying that he wanted to be a rabbi. His father had talked sense into him, and at the appropriate time, he had joined the family bank, along with his father, brothers, uncles, and grandfather before them. Theirs was a family steeped in tradition, and although Jacob's father had a great respect for the rabbinical life, he had no intention of sacrificing his son to it. And like the obedient son he was, Jacob went to work at the bank, and married shortly thereafter. At fifty, he was five years older than Beata's mother.<br> <br> The entire family agreed that the decision to summer in Switzerland this year had been a good one. The Wittgensteins had many friends here, and Jacob and Monika had attended a number of parties, as had their children. Jacob knew everyone in the Swiss banking community and had gone to Lausanne and Zurich to see friends in those cities as well. Whenever possible, they took the girls with them. While Horst and Ulm were there, they spent as much time as they could enjoying their company. Ulm was leaving for the front when he got back, and Horst was stationed at divisional headquarters in Munich, which he seemed to find vastly amusing. In spite of the serious upbringing he'd had, Horst was something of a playboy. He and Brigitte had much more in common with each other than either of them did with Beata.<br> <br> As she fell behind the others, walking slowly along the lake, her oldest brother Ulm hung back and fell into step beside her. He was always protective of her, perhaps because he was seven years older. Beata knew he respected her gentle nature and loving ways.<br> <br> "What are you thinking about, Bea? You look awfully serious walking along by yourself. Why don't you join us?"<br> <br> Her mother and sister were far ahead by then, talking about fashion and the men Brigitte had found handsome at the previous week's parties. The men in the family were talking about the only subjects that interested them--which these days were the war and banking. After the war, Ulm was going back to work at the bank again, as he had for four years before. Their father said that Horst was going to have to stop playing, become serious, and join them. Horst had promised that as soon as the war was over, he would. He was only twenty-two when war was declared the year before, and he had assured his father that when the war was over, he'd be ready. And Jacob had said several times recently that it was time for Ulm to get married. The one thing Jacob expected of his children, or anyone in his immediate circle actually, was that they obey him. He expected that of his wife as well, and she had never disappointed him. Nor had his children, with the exception of Horst, who had been dragging his feet about working when he went into the army. The last thing on Horst's mind at the moment was marriage. In fact, the only one interested in that prospect was Brigitte. Beata hadn't met a man who had swept her off her feet yet. Although she thought that many of her parents' friends' sons were handsome, many of the young ones seemed silly, and the older ones frightened her a bit and often seemed too somber. She was in no hurry to be married. Beata often said that if she married anyone, she hoped he would be a scholar, and not necessarily a banker. There was no way she could say that to her father, although she had confessed it to her mother and sister many times. Brigitte said that sounded boring. The handsome young friend of Horst's she had her eye on was as frivolous as she was, and from an equally important banking family. Jacob was intending to meet with the boy's father in September to discuss it, although Brigitte didn't know that. But so far, no suitor had emerged for Beata, nor did she really want one. She rarely spoke to anyone at parties. She went dutifully with her parents, wearing the dresses her mother chose for her. She was always polite to their hosts, and immensely relieved when it was time to go home. Unlike Brigitte, who had to be dragged away, complaining that it had been far too early to leave the party, and why did her family have to be so dull and boring. Horst was in complete agreement with her, and always had been. Beata and Ulm were the serious ones.<br> <br> "Have you had fun in Geneva?" Ulm asked Beata quietly. He was the only one who made a serious effort to speak to her, and find out what she was thinking. Horst and Brigitte were far too busy playing and having fun to spend time on more erudite subjects with their sister.<br> <br> "Yes, I have." Beata smiled shyly up at him. Even though he was her brother, Beata was always dazzled by how handsome he was, and how kind. He was a gentle person, and looked exactly like their father. Ulm was tall and blond and athletic, as Jacob had been in his youth. Ulm had blue eyes and features that often confused people, because he didn't look Jewish. Everyone knew they were, of course, and in the social world of Cologne, they were accepted in even the most aristocratic circles. Several of the Hohenlohes, and Thurn und Thaxis were childhood fri...</p><h2>The Beach</h2><p>Richard is drawn into a strange conversation in a hotel. He hears of a secret island Garden of Eden hidden in the scattered islands of a Thai marine park. Next morning, he finds a map pinned to his door and the man who put it there has slashed his wrists. The challenge is irresistible and he sets off on a perilous journey in search of Shangri-La.</p><p>In our ever-shrinking world, where popular Western culture seems to have infected every nation on the planet, it is hard to find even a small niche of unspoiled land--forget searching for pristine islands or continents. This is the situation in Alex Garland's debut novel, <i>The Beach</i>. Human progress has reduced Eden to a secret little beach near Thailand. In the tradition of grand adventure novels, Richard, a rootless traveler rambling around Thailand on his way somewhere else, is given a hand-drawn map by a madman who calls himself Daffy Duck. He and two French travelers set out on a journey to find this paradise. <p> What makes this a truly satisfying novel is the number of levels on which it operates. On the surface it's a fast-paced adventure novel; at another level it explores why we search for these utopias, be they mysterious lost continents or small island communes. Garland weaves a gripping and thought-provoking narrative that suggests we are, in fact, such products of our Western culture that we cannot help but pollute and ultimately destroy the very sanctuary we seek</p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Featuring new introductions by Ono and Wenner, and containing substantial material never before seen in print, <i>Lennon Remembers</i> presents a compelling portrait of a complex musical genius at the height of his career.

It features interviews (that read like thoughtful essays) with Joan Jett, Kathleen Hanna (Bikini Kill), Valerie Agnew (7 Year Bitch), Lois Maffeo, Naomi Yang (Galaxie 500), Kendra Smith, Phranc, Candice Pederson (K Records), Bettina Richards, Chrissie Hynde, and June Millington (Fanny, the "Godmothers of Womyn's Rock").</p><p><blockquote><i>We are currently at an interesting phase in the history of rock with the influx of women entering as a steady and unstoppable force. Perhaps, like a Trojan horse or a mutating virus, they can't help but change the status quo in, as yet, unknown ways. The best of these musicians choose to address a plurality of issues rather than dualistic and static sound-bites. They embrace paradoxical thinking, birthing new ways of expressing creativity, politics, humor, and poetics. Women now occupy simultaneously the male territory of "neutrality" that accompanies power while still retaining an "otherness"--a place alive with risk-taking creativity. This will not last long. Already, "women in rock" is not a novelty and in another generation their commonplaceness will hopefully mean creativity is finding avenues other than gender to inhabit. I look forward to a future where gender is no longer a glaring issue, defused from the territory of power, and we can address the more central concerns to our planetary survival and play.</i></blockquote> -- <i>From the Introduction</i><br><br>Creativity, sexuality, politics, fame, misogyny, strapping on rubber phalluses, all this is clearly dissected in question-and-answer format . -- <i>Q</i><br><br>This bookstuffed with ideas, history, wise (and wise-ass) remarks, and most importantly, hope for the futurewill be thumbed through often. -- <i>Puncture</i><br><br>[Today], indie chicks proliferate, all tousled and tight-trousered and signed to major labels.

Still, Juno got some good dirt from some pretty scary and hip women. Forget the laws of journalism: Juno needs her 13 subjects to be pissed, and many of them cooperate. The best parts of the book offer hands-on technique?7 Year Bitch's Valie Agnew on drumming; Naomi Yang, formerly of Galaxie 500, on playing bass?and discographies and equipment lists. One learns that erstwhile Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith was a slalom skiing racer, and that gender-teasing folkie Phranc was a nude model for art students. Luminary Joan Jett is too friendly to be angry, and Chrissie Hynde reminds us that "Cool people like their privacy." Juno can't avoid clumsy definitions of feminism, or resist denouncing certain activities (reading Vogue) or persons (Courtney Love, Robert Christgau) as vaguely counter to the cause. Her "Women in Rock Map" is woefully incomplete and places Brit Dusty Springfield in Memphis because she recorded her definitive album there. Worse, she leaves out angry women who rock the mic?where are Roxanne Shante, Queen Latifah and MC Lyte? Despite its inadequacies, the book is a worthwhile supplement for the collector of women-in-rock literature or women who want to take guitar in hand. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners: Cattle Goats Sheep Horses Pigs Poultry Rabbits Dogs Cats</h2><p><p>This easy-to-use reference guide provides everything you need to know about caring for and treating pets and barnyard animals.

Three years later, Cass returns, without her sister Emma. Her story is one of kidnapping and betrayal, of a mysterious island where the two were held. But to forensic psychiatrist Dr. Abby Winter, something doesn't add up. Looking deep within this dysfunctional family Dr. Winter uncovers a life where boundaries were violated and a narcissistic parent held sway. And where one sister's return might just be the beginning of the crime.</p><p>Bestselling author Wendy Walker returns with another winning thriller, <i>Emma in the Night.</i></p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2017:</strong> Wendy Walker&#x2019;s last novel, <em>All Is Not Forgotten</em> was a gritty psychological thriller that put readers on edge with intermittent flashes of brutality. In <em>Emma in the Night</em>, Walker has forsworn any cringe-inducing violence and instead brought her A-game of cat and mouse. Sisters Emma and Cass disappeared one night and, three years later, Cass shows up on her mother&#x2019;s doorstep with an incredible story of where they&#x2019;d been and how to find her older sister. The reader very quickly realizes that the mother is as narcissistic as they come and that there is something extremely distorted and ugly going on in this family. When the detective and forensic psychiatrist who first worked the case of the girls&#x2019; disappearance are brought back to the scene, more secrets are revealed. Each chapter adds another warped layer to the story, and just when you think you&#x2019;ve sorted out the villains and the victims, Walker forces you to reconsider. A memorable and highly satisfying thriller. <em>--Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review</em>WENDY WALKER has worked as an attorney specializing in family law.

Now she is working as an acrobat in a traveling circus, but she still continues to search for her twin and the man who took him. She hopes that she will find them in the royal city of Kingsbridge. Topper the juggler and Fisk the strongman plan to rob the royal treasury, and because Dessa is also desperate for money, she reluctantly joins them. Little does she know how much this one decision is going to change her life. This book contains a lot of action, but there are also numerous instances where readers will want to slow down and think about the story more deeply, as when Dessa has flashbacks about her family. Chantler's illustrations range from sepia-toned images to bright and colorful drawings that are full of life and action. The fantastic cover, featuring the three thieves leaping over rooftops as they try to avoid the arrows being fired at them from below, will definitely draw many readers into this engaging book. The exciting story and excellent illustrations will make <i>Tower of Treasure</i> an especially good choice for reluctant readers.&#x2014;<i>Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

A hissing tide of resentment roiled deep inside him, threatening to drown him. Clenching his fists at his sides, Stephen conquered the turmoil within. Through deliberately blank eyes, he looked at King Henry VIII.<br><br>"My liege," he said, blowing stiffly, inhaling the scent of dried lavender and bergamot from the sachets in the bed hangings. By the time he straightened up, the king's attendants had arrived to groom their sovereign for the day.<br><br>"Ah, Wimberleigh." The king put out his arms as an attendant scurried forward and helped him don a loose silk jacket. Henry smiled. In that smile there lingered yet a hint of the old charm, the derring-do of a golden young prince. A prince whom Stephen, as a boy, had idolized as the second Arthur.<br><br>The legendary Arthur had died young, in a blaze of glory. Henry had made the mistake of living on into the corrupt mediocrity of middle age.<br><br>"Come, come," said Henry, beckoning. He swung his swollen legs over the side of the bed and pushed his pale feet into a pair of brocade slippers held by a kneeling servant. "You may approach the royal bed. See what I've found you."<br><br>As he crossed the huge room, Stephen felt the searing curiosity of the sovereign's attendants. By now the chamber was crowded with titled gentlemen, all engaged to supervise the most intimate bodily functions of the king&#x2014;and also to influence the policies of the realm.<br><br>Sir Lambert Wilmeth, groom of the stool, took His Majesty's bowel movements as seriously as Scottish border disputes. Lord Harold Blodsmoor, surveyor of the wardrobe, regarded the king's collection of shoes as highly as the crown jewels. Yet at the moment, the attention of these great gentlemen burned into Stephen de Lacey.<br><br>The girl smiled shyly and even managed to summon an artful blush. She stretched with catlike grace, a bare shoulder emerging from the bedclothes. Like most of the king's mistresses, she took a perverse pride in sharing the bed of the sovereign.<br><br>After so many betrayals, Stephen should have known better than to trust the king. Should have known that the summons could only mean more petty cruelty.<br><br>"I was feeling frisky today." Henry's grin held both mischief and subtle rancor. Limping slightly, he went to the royal stool, speaking over his shoulder as he relieved himself. "I decided to exercise the droit du seigneur&#x2014; again. An antiquated notion, to be sure, but one that has its merits and deserves to be revived from time to time. Now, make a gracious greeting to your lady Gwenyth, and then we'll&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sire," Stephen broke in, heedless of the gasps from the noblemen present. No one interrupted the king. In the thirty years of his reign, Henry VIII had put men to death for lesser offenses.<br><br>Instantly Stephen regretted the risk he had taken. With that one blurted word he might have jeopardized everything.<br><br>"Yes?" The king seemed only mildly annoyed as his gentlemen helped him into doublet and hose. "What is it, Wimberleigh?"<br><br>Stephen couldn't help himself. A killing rage rose like a fountain of fire inside him. "To hell with your droit du seigneur."<br><br>He turned on his heel and strode from the Royal Bedchamber. Though well aware of the infraction he was committing, he could not be a willing player in the familiar, vicious diversion that so delighted Henry.<br><br>The red-and-white livery of the king's Welsh yeomen passed in a blur as Stephen strode out into the paved central court. Seeking a place to cool his temper in private, he stalked into a walled garden. A pebbled path led him through tortured little plots of whitethorn and sweetbriar. The flower beds had been arranged geometrically, so that they resembled rather coarse mosaics.<br><br>Stephen wished for the hundredth time that he had ignored the king's annual summons and stayed in Wiltshire.<br><br>But to refuse the command was to risk the one thing Stephen would kill to safeguard. If the price of keeping his secret was to have his heart ripped out and his pride publicly shredded, then so be it.<br><br>His conviction that the king hadn't finished with him proved correct, for an hour later, a haughty majordomo summoned him to the Presence Chamber.<br><br>An open-timbered ceiling arched high over the hall. The watery sunlight of early spring streamed in through twin banks of mullioned windows. Colored glass made a shifting, jeweled pattern on the walls and floor. Somewhere, an unseen lute player strummed softly, the shimmering music a sweet undercurrent to the murmur of voices.<br><br>Members of the Privy Council stood by, sharp eyed, their shoulders hunched beneath heavy, long robes.<br><br>Stephen paced over the smooth flagstones to the gold-and-scarlet-draped dais. There he stopped, swept his satin-lined cloak back over one shoulder, and sank into a formal obeisance. Even without looking at the king, he knew Henry relished the submissive pose of a man of Stephen's height. Henry took pleasure in anything that made Stephen feel smaller.<br><br>He rose with hatred and defiance clear in his eyes, and a gift in his extended hands.<br><br>Henry sat upon his massive carved chair, looking like Bacchus clad in silver and gold. In recent years, his face had grown as large as a haunch of beef.<br><br>"What's this?" he asked, nodding to a page. The lad took the small wooden coffer from Stephen and offered it to the king. With childlike haste, Henry opened it and extracted a tiny watch on a golden chain. "Marry, my lord, you never fail to amaze me."<br><br>"A trinket, no more," Stephen said in a flat, dead voice. Henry had many appetites, most of them insatiable. Satisfying his craving for unique gifts was no challenge.<br><br>Henry slipped the chain through the baldric that encircled his ample girth. "I assume the design is original."<br><br>Stephen nodded.<br><br>"You've a rare talent for inventions of all sorts, Wim-berleigh. A pity you are so lacking in plain manners." The breadth of his cheeks made his eyes look beady, his mouth thin lipped and tight. "You left the Royal Bedchamber without begging leave, my lord."<br><br>"So I did, sire."<br><br>Henry's hand, pudgy and sparkling with rings, smacked down on the arm of his chair. His fingers strangled a carved gargoyle. "Damn your eyes, Wimberleigh. Must you always breach the limits of propriety and decorum?"<br><br>"Only when provoked, sire."<br><br>The king's expression did not change, yet his small bright eyes took fire. "Has it never occurred to you," he asked in a soft, deadly voice, "that you might do better to dance with your betrothed rather than with my patience? Lady Gwenyth is beautiful. She's well-bred and reasonably wealthy."<br><br>"She is also ruined, sire."<br><br>"I did honor to the wench," Henry snapped. "There is only one king of England, just as there is only one sun. My favor is not for one alone."<br><br>Stephen bit his tongue to stop himself from responding. It was useless to quarrel with a man who likened himself to a heavenly body. He could satisfy his every whim all too easily, for what sane man or woman would dare refuse him?<br><br>"For God's sake, Stephen," Henry thundered, "your evasiveness bedevils me. I've found you four eligible ladies in the past year, and you've refused them all. What is it that makes you so much better than any other noble?"<br><br>"I do not wish to marry again," Stephen stated. He could not resist adding, "My favor is for no one, not even that silly Welsh comfit I found in your bed."<br><br>"Comfits are sweet and agreeable to the palate," Henry pointed out.<br><br>"Aye, but when handled by too many fingers, they lose their savor. And when left long enough to themselves, they rot."<br><br>Without taking his eyes off Stephen, the king held out his hand. A servitor stepped forward and placed in it a silver cup of sack. Henry drank deeply of the Canary wine, then said, "Ah. Still you pine for your Margaret, now seven years cold."<br><br>With all that he was, Stephen resisted the urge to bury his fist in his sovereign's face. How blithely Henry spoke of Meg&#x2014;as if he had never even known her at all.<br><br>"Was she so very dear to you, then," the king went on, twisting the knife, "that you cannot love another?"<br><br>Stephen held himself motionless as his mind filled with memories of Meg. Peeking at him timidly from behind her veil on their wedding day. Weeping in pain and fear in their marriage bed. Hiding her secrets from the husband who adored her. Dying in a sea of blood and bitter curses.<br><br>"Margaret was&#x2014;" Stephen cleared his throat"&#x2014;a child. Gullible. Easily impressed." With terrible, blade-sharp guilt, he knew he had forced her into womanhood and then into motherhood. And finally and most unforgivably, into death.<br><br>"I know well what it is to mourn a wife," Henry said, an unexpected note of sympathy in his voice. Stephen knew he was thinking of quiet, dutiful Jane Seymour, who had died giving the king the one gift he craved above all others: a male heir to the throne.<br><br>"However," Henry continued, imperious again, "a wife is a necessary ornament to a man's station, and old memories should not make you balk at duty. Now. As to the Welsh lady&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sire, I humbly beg your pardon." He dropped his voice so only the king could hear. "I will not take any man's leavings&#x2014;not even those of the king of England. I'll not be a salve to your conscience."<br><br>"My conscience?" Henry's mouth curved into a cold sickle of amusement. His voice was a whisper meant for Stephen alone. "My dear lord of Wimberleigh, where on earth did you get the notion that I had one?"<br><br>Stephen's neck tingled. He reminded himself that Henry VIII had put aside his first wife and brought about the execution of the second. He had appropriated the authority of the church, taken possession of monasteries, driven the poor from their lands. The mere ruining of a young virgin would hardly trouble a man like Henry Tudor.<br><br>"My mistake," Stephen replied softly. "But never mind, the Lady Gwenyth would not want me anyway."<br><br>"Ah, your tarnished reputation," Henry said, waving his now-empty cup. "Wild revels, gambling and rapine. The gossip does find its way to court. Marry, sir, every maiden in the realm quails in fright at the very thought of you."<br><br>Stephen preferred it that way. He had worked hard to hide his few good qualities beneath a patina of ill repute. "I am a man of low morals. An unfortunate flaw in my character. And now if it please Your Majesty, I must withdraw from court."<br><br>With a swiftness that belied his age and bulk, the king came out of his chair. His thick-fingered hand closed in the front of Stephen's quilted doublet. "By God, it does <em>not </em>please me." He put his face very close to Stephen's, so close that Stephen could smell the warm sweetness of sack on his breath. "Get you a wife, Wimberleigh, and then get you a proper heir, else all of England will know what you hide at your Wiltshire estate."<br><br>An animal roar of denial surged to Stephen's throat. With an effort born of years of iron control, he forced himself to keep from tearing into the royal face. How Henry had come to know Stephen's terrible secret was a mystery; how he intended to use the knowledge was becoming painfully obvious.<br><br>With a will, Stephen expelled his breath slowly and stepped back. The king no longer gripped him, yet the hold lingered invisibly&#x2014;would linger until Stephen shed himself once and for all of the king's ire.<br><br>"To your knees, Wimberleigh."<br><br>His cheeks on fire with rage, Stephen sank down.<br><br>"Now swear it. Let me hear you vow that you will obey me." The king's voice rang loud. "Let me hear that you will wed&#x2014;if not Lady Gwenyth, then another."<br><br>The command hung, suspended, in the deafening silence that followed. From his low perspective, Stephen caught details with uncommon clarity: the ancient dust clinging to the hem of the king's cloak, the faint, septic smell of the ulcer on Henry's leg, the soft <em>chink </em>of the sovereign's chain of office as his massive chest rose and fell, and the dying echo of a plucked lute string.<br><br>All the court waited in a state of breath-held anticipation. The king had flung down the gauntlet, had challenged one of the few men in the realm who dared defy him.<br><br>Stephen de Lacey was no fool, and he valued his neck. The years, at least, had taught him to equivocate. "Your will be done, sire." He spoke clearly so all could hear, for he knew if he mumbled the pledge, the king would make him repeat it.<br><br>A collective sigh came from the Privy Councillors. How they loved seeing one of their own humiliated.<br><br>Henry lowered his vast bulk onto the throne. "I trust you'll obey this time."<br><br>Stephen stood. The king dismissed him with a curt nod. Almost immediately, Henry began to bellow for his attendants. "Saddle my horse, I wish to go riding."<br><br>Stephen left the Presence Chamber and passed through the antechamber. The air of corruption lingered even here, in the heavy scent of sandalwood burning in a corner brazier, in the stale mats of rushes that had not been changed in months.<br><br>Prior to his audience, Stephen had requested that his horse be brought out, for he wanted to be away swiftly. The grooms of the royal stables had promised to have the tall Neapolitan mare ready outside the west gate.<br><br>Stephen strode across the courtyard and passed between the octagonal-shaped twin towers.

A companion volume to the first large-scale exhibition on Land art, this book traces the emergence of the artistic impulses to use the earth as material, land as medium, and to locate works in remote sites, beyond familiar art contexts. Ends of the Earth challenges many myths about Land art-that it was primarily a North American phenomenon, that it was foremost a sculptural practice, and that it exceeds the confines of the art system. Essays by leading young scholars will offer new insights into Land art&#39;s emergence, including its intrinsic connection to media, its dreams of an elsewhere, the attraction of wastelands, and the problems inherent in a historical evaluation of site-specific or ephemeral art. The book will also include a series of reflections from the major curators, critics, and dealers who helped to make Land art both as work and discourse in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>The fascinating and generously illustrated catalogue documents the history of Land art from its emergence during the early 1960s through 1974.

He, along with Leslie Dyball, won the handicap prize for first overall in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race.

You see the smokers, the overeaters, the bottle-feeders, and affirm your own health in the process. In these and countless other instances, the perception of your own health depends in part on your value judgments about others, and appealing to health allows for a set of moral assumptions to fly stealthily under the radar.<br>Against Health argues that health is a concept, a norm, and a set of bodily practices whose ideological work is often rendered invisible by the assumption that it is a monolithic, universal good. And, that disparities in the incidence and prevalence of disease are closely linked to disparities in income and social support. To be clear, the book's stand against health is not a stand against the authenticity of people's attempts to ward off suffering. Against Health instead claims that individual strivings for health are, in some instances, rendered more difficult by the ways in which health is culturally configured and socially sustained.<br>The book intervenes into current political debates about health in two ways. First, Against Health compellingly unpacks the divergent cultural meanings of health and explores the ideologies involved in its construction. Second, the authors present strategies for moving forward. They ask, what new possibilities and alliances arise? What new forms of activism or coalition can we create? What are our prospects for well-being? In short, what have we got if we ain't got health? Against Health ultimately argues that the conversations doctors, patients, politicians, activists, consumers, and policymakers have about health are enriched by recognizing that, when talking about health, they are not all talking about the same thing. And, that articulating the disparate valences of &#x201c;health&#x201d; can lead to deeper, more productive, and indeed more healthy interactions about our bodies.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan M.

Now, with a new understanding of the process born of a deep personal crisis, Bridges brings us <i>The Way of Transition,</i> a richly textured, deep map of the personal, professional, and emotional transformations that grow out of tragedy and crisis. Eloquently explaining the mechanics of transition through his own moving story, Bridges demonstrates how disillusionment, sorrow, or confusion can blossom into a time of incredible creativity and contentment, highlighting the profound significance and true value of endings in our lives. Instructive and inspiring, <i>The Way of Transition,</i> reveals the transformative power of life's disappointments, demonstrating how to harness them for personal rejuvenation.</p><p>When author Bill Bridges's wife died from breast cancer, he began to question all his previous groundbreaking work on transitions. Having conducted seminars and written bestselling books (<i>Transitions</i>, <i>Managing Transitions</i>), Bridges had built a reputation as an expert on the topic. And yet, "I felt now that my words had totally failed to match in depth the experience of actually being in transition," he explains. After floundering in self-doubt for months after his wife died, Bridges embarked on a spiritual pilgrimage through Wales. During his visits to sacred sites, Bridges began to see that he hadn't been misguiding people. Rather, he simply had <i>more</i> to offer on the subject of transition--more depth, more spirit, and above all else, more experience. So at 66 years old he wrote this excellent and highly personal book in which he examines the pain and challenge of transition--how it is a time of letting go of the past while taking hold of the future.<p> Because Bridges weaves his personal story into the narrative he comes off as a wizened sage rather than a cocky aficionado. "Change can come at any time, but transition comes along when one chapter of your life is over and another is waiting in the wings to make its entrance," he begins. "Needless to say it is impossible to imagine a new chapter is starting when your wife's death has just closed down what feels like your whole life. You simply cannot imagine a new chapter...." Overall, this is a book that offers an abundance of insights without faltering into self-help clich�s or specific how-to advice. Instead, Bridges examines the events that bring about transition (marriage, death, change of vocation, tragedy, and crisis) and why it's so important to fully experience these transitions and how they offer opportunities for closure as well as launch pads for enormous personal growth. Readers of <i>The Way of Transition</i> will find an author who manages to be humble, accessible, and highly intelligent as he weaves the writings of Tolstoy, Herman Hesse, Emily Dickinson, Carl Jung, and An&amp;aumlaut;is Nin into his personal reflections. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>William Bridges is a consultant and lecturer based in Mill Valley, California. Formerly a professor of English, he made a shift to the field of transitional management in the mid-1970s; out of his workshops grew a long career helping others through transitions. Past president of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, Bridges was rated by the Wall Street Journal in 1993 as one of the ten most popular executive development consultants in the U.S.</p><h2>How to Eat Fried Worms</h2><p><b>Fans of <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>, <i>The Worst Class Trip Ever</i>, and the Tapper Twins series "will revolt and delight" in <i>How to Eat Fried Worms</i> (<i>Booklist</i>).</b><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; People are always daring Billy to do zany things.

He throws himself into the role of a 10-year-old boy, facing the most revolting bet of his life. Billy must eat 15 worms in 15 days--but the reward will be worth it: $50 for a shiny new minibike. Luckily, Billy's friends cook up these fat juicy grubs in a variety of appetizing ways--drenched in ketchup and mustard, fried in butter and cornmeal, and the pi�ce de r�sistance, a Whizband Worm Delight (an ice-cream worm cake). Sanders derives obvious pleasure from reading (and singing) out loud the hilarious rhymes and childish chants concocted from the mind of the book's author, Thomas Rockwell.<p> "Trout, Salmon, flounder, perch,<br> I'll ride my minibike into church.<br> Dace, tuna, haddock, trout,<br> Wait'll you hear the minister shout."</p><p> <i>How to Eat Fried Worms</i> is a ghastly gastronomical treat that will dazzle young listeners.

The story of Gist's personality, dedication, courage and ability is a moving one that brings home the cost of war." --Orlando Sentinel "In the final analysis, Cisco's States Rights Gist is a well-written book about a little-known Civil War general, making it a valuable literary contribution." --Civil War Regiments </p><p> "Walter Brian Cisco has revealed the eloquent, brilliant, and respected young Southerner behind the name." --Southern Partisan</p><p>Named in honor of his father's strong political beliefs and educated at Harvard Law School, South Carolina's States Rights Gist became an important leading militia general in the Civil War.</p><p>From his participation in the first shots fired at Fort Sumter, Gist helped strengthen the Confederate army and train new recruits to fight against the invading Union troops. A lawyer by trade and with little military training, Gist proved himself a capable and determined leader throughout the war.

His death marked another loss for the fading Confederacy, as he was one of six generals killed in John Bell Hood's useless and futile charge.

She lives in Westbrook, CT.Grade 7-10-- Cooney's The Face on the Milk Carton (Bantam, 1990) involved a 15-year-old girl who discovers she had been kidnapped when she was 3. Those left hanging by the ambiguous ending to that story will want to read this sequel in which Janie goes to live with her biological parents and four siblings. Although all of the family members are eager to include her, she's determined to remain emotionally aloof. Finally, Janie asserts her desire to return to her adopted family, and her biological parents love her enough to let her go. The strength of this book is that all of the parties are easy to empathize with. They are well-rounded characters with quirks and annoying qualities, yet all have compassion for "the other guy," even while feeling their own pain. The suspense centers around the question of which family needs Janie more and which she will choose. There is no clear answer to her dilemma since both love her and have suffered through no fault of their own. While Janie ultimately puts her own feelings first by choosing the family that is "real" to her, the stage is set for future changes of heart and perhaps another sequel.

But for many of us, that is a terrifying thought. ow can we approach complete strangers and start talking with them about Christ? Where do we begin?

Shan has agreed to lead an expedition to return the eye of an idol, stolen almost a century ago and recently, clandestinely recovered, to a distant valley, an act that will fulfill an important Tibetan prophecy. But the pilgrimage turns into a desperate flight when the monk who is to lead them is murdered. Shan also discovers that the stone was stolen back from a brigade of the Chinese army that is now in hot pursuit.<br><br>Still possessing an investigator's love of truth, Shan faces a perplexing tangle of mysteries. Why are the Chinese so desperate to retrieve the stone eye, why has an American geologist abandoned the oil company's drilling project and fled into the mountains, and why are rumors sweeping the countryside that an ancient lama is returning to liberate this country? As he digs into these questions, Shan realizes that there is more at stake than mere justice: the spiritual survival of his people is in danger as well. <br><br>Complex and compelling, <i>Bone Mountain</i> is a spectacular achievement from a major voice in crime fiction.<br></p><p>Shan, an ex-police inspector who spent years in a Chinese prison, is the intriguing protagonist of this literary thriller set in the stunning and rarely portrayed landscape of modern Tibet. While Shan's search for a stolen sacred relic in a Himalayan valley whose underground wealth is the center of explorations by a Sino-American oil consortium provides the novel's central plot, the real crime, Beijing's efforts to eradicate the remnants of Tibet's spiritual and cultural heritage, is more fully and engagingly portrayed. The central motif of the novel--Shan's travels with a salt caravan, at first guarding and then searching for the relic after it mysteriously disappears-- becomes a journey toward enlightenment whose denouement is more than worth the trip for readers who opt to suspend disbelief and travel with Shan and his companions to the centuries-old cave of the medicine lamas. <i>Bone Mountain</i> is a rich, complicated, and original exploration into the extraordinary power of belief, faith, and the triumph of the human spirit, as complex and compelling as Tibet itself. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Eliot Pattison is the author of <i>The Skull Mantra</i>, which was a finalist for the Gold Dagger and winner of the Edgar Award, and <i>Water Touching Stone</i>.

Initially, she inspires surprise, then wariness and finally acceptance by the Clan. She is cared for by its medicine woman, Iza, and its wise holy man, Creb. But she makes an implacable enemy of the group&#39;s future leader, Broud. He will do all he can to destroy her - but Ayla is a survivor. Jean Auel&#39;s imaginative reconstruction of pre-historic life, rich in detail of language, culture, myth and ritual, has become a set text in schools and colleges around the world.</p><p>When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power. A moving saga about people, relationships and the boundaries of love. Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla. Her enthralling story is one we all can share. A natural disaster has left young Ayla alone, wandering, fending for herself in an unfamiliar land. One day, she is discovered by the Clan of the Cave bear, men and women far different from her own people. Tall, blond, blue-eyed Ayla is a mysterious stranger to the Clan and at first they mistrust her and cast her out. But as she grows to know them and to learn the ways of the Clan, she is welcomed. And as she leads them in their struggle for survival, the Clan come to worship Ayla. For in her blood flows the future of humanity.</p><h2>Jewelry Lab: 52 Experiments, Investigations, and Explorations in Metal (Lab Series)</h2><p><em>Jewelry Lab</em> uses brevity to ignite a passion for working the metals processes and learning about all the ways metal can be used.

From his base at Spences Bridge, BC, Teit forged a participantbased anthropology that was far ahead of its time. Whereas his contemporaries, including famed anthropologist Franz Boas, studied Indigenous peoples as members of &#34;dying cultures,&#34; Teit worked with them as members of living cultures resisting colonial influence over their lives and lands. Whether recording stories, mapping placenames, or participating in the chiefs&#39; fight for fair treatment, he made their objectives his own. With his allies, he produced copious, meticulous records; an army of anthropologists could not have achieved a fraction of what he achieved in his short life. Wickwire&#39;s beautifully crafted narrative accords Teit the status he deserves, consolidating his place as a leading and innovative anthropologist in his own right.</p><p><em>At the Bridge</em> lifts from obscurity the story of James Teit (1864&#x2013;1922), an outstanding Canadian ethnographer and Indian rights activist whose thoughtful scholarship and tireless organizing have been largely ignored.Wendy Wickwire is professor emerita in the Department of History at the University of Victoria.</p><h2>Unobstructed Universe</h2><p>An undisputed classic in the field of psychic exploration, The Unobstructed Universe is as important to human understanding as the tales of Marco Polo 600 years ago.

Tour.</p><p>Teacher-turned-writer Alfie Kohn takes on traditional-education giants like E.D. Hirsch, along with practically every state government "raising the bar" and toughening standards, in this attack on the back-to-basics movement. An established critic of America's fixation on grades and test scores, Kohn has written a detailed, methodical treatise that accuses politicians and educators of replacing John Dewey, the father of public education, with test-tutoring king Stanley Kaplan. The current standards movement that demands students learn a list of dates and facts prepares kids for <i>Jeopardy</i>, Kohn argues, not real life. He joins David C. Berliner and Bruce J. Biddle (<i>The Manufactured Crisis</i>) in questioning whether today's schools are truly floundering, warning that romantic memories of the old school, with its tests, worksheets, and drills, are purely that--memories romanticized by time and perception.<p> Kohn backs up his argument with research and observations from like-minded reformers such as Deborah Meier, but his position is nothing new. Rather, it is a volley back at traditionalists, a direct counter to Hirsch's 1996 book <i>The Schools We Need</i>, which Kohn critically dissects at length, even accusing Hirsch of incorrectly generalizing footnoted research. Kohn also takes issue with the backlash against the whole-language approach to reading instruction (though this argument wears thin, given that many schools have already moved beyond the debate to use a combination of whole language and phonics). The overall message of <i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i> is a valid cautionary tale about the future of American education that deserves to be heard out by teachers, policymakers, and parents. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>Are our schools in trouble because they have lowered their standards and strayed too far from the basics? Just the opposite, says Alfie Kohn: if American students are getting less than they deserve, it's due to simplistic demands to "raise the bar" and an aggressive nostalgia for traditional teaching. <p>Alfie Kohn, the author of critically acclaimed works on such subjects as competition and rewards, now turns the conventional wisdom about education on its head. In this landmark book, he shows how the "back to basics" philosophy of teaching treats children as passive receptacles into which forgettable facts are poured. Likewise, shrill calls for Tougher Standards are responsible for squeezing the intellectual life out of classrooms. Such politicized slogans reflect a lack of understanding about how and why kids learn, and they force teachers to spend time preparing students for standardized tests instead of helping them to become critical, creative thinkers. </p><p>Kohn has an ambitious yet practical vision of what our children's classrooms could be like. Drawing on a remarkable body of research, he helps parents and others interested in education understand the need to move beyond a "bunch o' facts" model of teaching. Using stories from real classrooms, he shows how this can be done. Along the way, he offers surprising insights about the Whole Language-versus-phonics controversy, why a straight-A report card may not be good news, and how we can best gauge the progress of schools and students. </p><p><i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i> presents a fresh perspective on today's headlines about education--and on what our children will be asked to do in class tomorrow morning. It is a persuasive invitation to rethink our most basic assumptions about schooling.</p></p><h2>Handguns of the World: Military Revolvers and self-loaders from 1870 to 1945.</h2><p>large oversized hardbound with dust cover</p><p></p><h2>Races of the Wild (Dungeons and Dragons v3.5 Supplement) (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p>A new D&amp;D sourcebook detailing various races that dwell in wilderness.<br><br>Races of the Wild provides Dungeons &amp; Dragons� players with an in-depth look at races that live in the wildest areas of the D&amp;D world.

Both men came to power during World War II, reached their professional peaks during the Cold War&#x2019;s most frightening moments, and fought epic political battles that spanned decades. Yet despite their very different views, Paul Nitze and George Kennan dined together, attended the weddings of each other&#x2019;s children, and remained good friends all their lives.</p><p>In this masterly double biography, Nicholas Thompson brings Nitze and Kennan to vivid life. Nitze&#x2014;the hawk&#x2014;was a consummate insider who believed that the best way to avoid a nuclear clash was to prepare to win one. More than any other American, he was responsible for the arms race. Kennan&#x2014;the dove&#x2014;was a diplomat turned academic whose famous &#x201c;X article&#x201d; persuasively argued that we should contain the Soviet Union while waiting for it to collapse from within. For forty years, he exercised more influence on foreign affairs than any other private citizen.</p><p>As he weaves a fascinating narrative that follows these two rivals and friends from the beginning of the Cold War to its end, Thompson accomplishes something remarkable: he tells the story of our nation during the most dangerous half century in history. </p></p><p><p>Nicholas Thompson is an editor at Wired magazine, a fellow at the New America Foundation, and a regular contributor to CNN. He has written articles for The New York Times, The Washington Post and numerous other publications. A grandson of Paul Nitze&#x2019;s, he lives in New York City with his wife and son.</p>Working in the intricate web of American diplomacy during the Cold War, Paul Nitze and George Kennan became legendary.

The myth began during his lifetime when few verbal or visual portrayals of the composer adhered strictly to his physical appearance; instead his mannerisms, manners, and moods prevailed. Promoted from peevish recluse to Promethean hero, he was pictured early on as a &#39;genius inspired by inner voices in the presence of nature, with leonine hair writhing wildly in symbolic parallel to the seething turbulence of creativity,&#39; according to the author. In this unique study of the myth-making process across two centuries, Alessandra Comini examines the contradictory imagery of Beethoven in contemporary verbal accounts and in some 200 paintings, prints, sculptures, and monuments. With a witty yet penetrating narrative, she moves through these images to construct a collective image of the composer that reflects the many differing impressions left by devoted &#39;myth makers&#39; ranging from Wagner, Nietzsche, Berlioz, and Brahms to Rolland, D&#39;Annunzio, and Jenny Lind.</p><p>University Distinguished Professor of Art History Emerita at Southern Methodist University, Alessandra Comini is the author of eight books, one of which was nominated for the National Book Award (<i>Egon Schiele's Portraits</i>). The Republic of Austria extended her its Grand Decoration of Honor in 1990, the National Women's Caucus for Art gave her a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995, and a Comini Lecture Series in her honor was founded in Dallas in 2005. She is associate producer of Museum Music's just-released recording <i>Klimt Musik</i>, featuring composers from Beethoven to Alma and Gustav Mahler.<p>"Your unusual fantasy and passion for what you do will guarantee once again that your views on Beethoven are convincing." --Kurt Masur, Conductor Emeritus, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, New York Philharmonic</p><p> </p><p>"Comini has crafted a magisterial narrative that begins in Beethoven's lifetime and culminates in that defining event of Viennese modernism, the Secession Exhibition of 1902. Such an analysis of the construction of a cultural myth has never been so satisfyingly realized." --Scott Messing, Charles A. Dana Professor of Music, Alma College</p><p> </p><p>"Since its appearance, Alessandra Comini's <em>The Changing Image of Beethoven</em> has become the classic study of Beethoven iconography that is so engrossingly written it is difficult to put down. Beethoven becomes a lens through which we view the past two centuries with deepened understanding." --William Rhea Meredith, Ph.D., Director, The Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies</p><p> </p><p>"Of the many books on Beethoven to have appeared in recent years, I would go so far as to say that I regard this work to be one of the most original contributions to Beethoven scholarship since Maynard Solomon's landmark biography of 1977. Unlike a biography, however, Dr. Comini's book focuses attention on the figure of Beethoven and his changing reception history. Despite its remarkable scope, this book wears its scholarship lightly. It is eminently readable, and always popular with my students." --<strong>Eric Wen, Chairman of Musical Studies, The Curtis Institute of Music</strong></p></p><h2>A Kiss of Shadows (Meredith Gentry, Book 1)</h2><p>"All it would take was my true name being mentioned after dark, and it would float back to my aunt. She was the Queen of Air and Darkness, and that meant that anything said in the dark was hers to hear, eventually. The fact that spotting the missing Elven American Princess had become more popular than spotting Elvis helped. Her magic was always chasing blind leads. Princess Meredith skiing in Utah. Princess Meredith dancing in Paris. Princess Meredith gambling in Vegas. After three years I was still a front-page story for the tabloids, though the latest headlines had been speculating that I was dead as the King of Rock and Roll . . ."<br><br>Three years ago, Princess Meredith fled the court of her cruel Aunt Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness, leaving that garden of decadent delights and backstabbing intrigues for the comparative calm of Los Angeles.

Hamilton's bestselling series of novels featuring Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, established her as one of the hottest new writers of dark fantasy and erotic horror. Now, in a thrilling adventure of unbridled imagination, Hamilton turns her talents to the glittering, myth-drenched lands of Faerie and brings them brilliantly into the postmodern age. Enter a thrilling, sensual world as threatening as it is beautiful, replete with the titanic passions of immortal beings once worshipped as gods or demons. Full of earthly pleasures and dazzling magic, Laurell K. Hamilton's A Kiss of Shadows will hold you under its hypnotic spell.</p><p>Laurell K. Hamilton revitalized vampires, werewolves, and zombies in the popular Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter books. In this new series, she updates faeries. <i>A Kiss of Shadows</i> introduces Merry Gentry, a.k.a. Meredith NicEssus, a faerie princess of the Unseelie Court, where politics is a blood sport. Merry, who's part sidhe (elvish), part brownie, and part human, never really fit in. She's short, not skilled in offensive magic, and mortal because of her human blood. These are real liabilities when your family, especially aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, is out to kill you. Merry has been in hiding for three years, living in Los Angeles and working for the Grey Detective Agency, which specializes in "supernatural problems, magical solutions." A new case sets her against a man who uses forbidden magic to seduce fey women and drain their power. A plan to trap him goes awry and Merry's cover is blown. Now Andais knows where she is. But things have changed in Andais's court, and Merry is changing too.<p> Despite the selkies, brownies, goblins, and ogres in this book, it's not for children. The fey are "creatures of the senses"--and in the Unseelie court, sex and pain go together. Merry is sexually adventurous and surrounded by gorgeous, powerful males, most of whom want her badly. She's politically savvy and no coward, though she's not the warrior Anita is. Hamilton fans and readers of adult fairy tales like Anne Bishop's Black Jewels trilogy will want to give Merry a look. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><br>"Hamilton takes her world by the teeth and runs with it."<br>--Locus<br></p><h2>Darkwell (Forgotten Realms, Moonshae Trilogy, Book 3)</h2><p>Upon their return to Corwell, Tristan and Robyn discover the dark powers of Bhaal in ascendancy, with their druid friends imprisoned in stone and the Moonwell turned into a Darkwell</p><p>Douglas Niles is the author of over 20 fantasy novels, many of which were published with Wizards of the Coast, Inc.

Jack Kerouac wrote his masterpiece in one frenzied three-week period in 1951 on the infamous 119-foot scroll, which has been on the road&#x201d; touring the nation since 2004, slated to continue on through spring 2008. The scroll will also be published in its original, unedited version in book form for the very first time in 2007. Tying into the anniversary and the resurgence of the Beat movement in our collective cultural consciousness is our lavishly illustrated book <i>The Beats</i>, a spectacular record of that most explosive period, when the conservative blandness of '50s America gave way to the artistic, social, and sexual liberation of the '60s. With over 200 illustrations, many rarely seen before, the book tells the story of the Beat Generation from its subterranean beginnings in New York and San Francisco to world-wide acclaim. Set against the backdrop of seedy student pads, smoky jazz cellars, and-most crucially-the open road, it's a story of a rebellion that challenged society's attitudes towards sex, drugs, and freedom of speech. Following the turbulent saga of Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and the other Beats via reckless love affairs, obscenity trials, murder cases, and press vilification, to media celebrity and the Beatnik&#x201d; craze that followed, their story represents the evolution of the counterculture from hipsters to hippies. Featuring a wealth of first-hand quotes, archive documentation, and exclusive interview material with Beat wife, muse, and chronicler Carolyn Cassady, <i>The Beats</i> is a timely celebration of a seminal-and often neglected-era in modern popular culture.</p><p><b>Mike Evans</b> is a musician and writer whose involvement in the '60s poetry scene in the UK brought him into close contact with Beats like Allen Ginsberg and Ted Joans. He began in the '70s to write about popular culture for major publications, and, in the '80s turned to book publishing. Evans is the author of several books on the music scene as well as on icons like the Beatles, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, and Ray Charles. He lives in Rhyl, North Wales.As a basic literary overview of the major figures and events of the beat generation, Evans's handsome coffee-table book serves its purpose satisfactorily, if not with particular attention to insight or detail. Evans, for example, perfunctorily recounts Kerouac's oft-cited Benzedrine-fueled writing of <i>On the Road</i> with no mention of the fact that most recent publications have downgraded his principal writing aid to coffee. Someone looking for biographical complexity, however, has an ever-growing library of other volumes to choose from; this book's value lies largely in the photographs, original book covers and various other visual elements that enhance nearly every page. Evans does an elegant job of visually charting the beats' trajectory from the intensely personal inner circle of the '40s and mid-'50s to the national praise, misunderstanding and often ridicule that greeted their ideals in the late '50s and '60s. He accomplishes this transition by subtly shifting the bulk of visual material from intimate photos of the principal figures to an expanding network of junk (<i>The Beat Generation Cookbook</i>) and inspiration (the happenings of Claes Oldenberg) that mirrors the mass culture explosion of America through the decades.

He terrorized towns and villages in order to try to gain control of the state, murdering people and adding their fingers to his gruesome necklace. The buddha set out to meet angulimala, and with the power of love and compassion he persuaded him to renounce violence and take responsibility for his past actions. Thus angulimala was transformed. The buddha and the terrorist brings a message for our time about the importance of looking for the root causes of violence, and of finding peaceful means to end terror.

But after several idyllic days of exploring, he's hit with some bad luck. He can't find his way home, and he runs into a hungry alligator who takes a bite out of his canoe. When he pulls up to a remote island, he finds another surprise: a mystery that will reach far into his own past . . . and force him to question the world he's left behind.</p></p><p><p>Jean Craighead George wrote over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her novel <em>Julie of the</em> <em>Wolves</em> won the Newbery Medal in 1973, and she received a 1960 Newbery Honor for <em>My Side of the Mountain</em>. She continued to write acclaimed picture books that celebrate the natural world. Her other books with Wendell Minor include <em>The Wolves Are Back</em>; <em>Luck</em>; <em>Everglades</em>; <em>Arctic Son</em>; <em>Morning, Noon, and Night</em>; and <em>Galapagos George</em>.</p>Combining survival tale, nature study, mystery and legend, Newbery Medalist George (Julie of the Wolves) serves up an ultimately unsatisfying stew. While his parents vacation in Europe, 13-year-old Jack, the narrator, stays on his Uncle Hamp's farm on the St. Mary's River in Georgia. Hamp goes off to help a neighbor for at least a week or two... maybe more, and Jack decides the time is ripe to paddle his homemade canoe to the source of St. Mary's, the great Okefenokee Swamp, and search for the fabled Paradise Island. That Paradise, Jack muses, is a fantasy for most people [but] Uncle Hamp says it's part of a human quest for discovery. When an alligator tears a hole in Jack's canoe, the boy finds himself stranded on a small island, where he becomes acquainted with the wildlife and vegetation, builds himself shelter and forages for food. While George demonstrates her expertise as a naturalist, she relaxes the pacing to such an extent that almost no tension remains in the narrative. Jack, underdeveloped as a character, approaches his adventure with matter-of-fact calm. A puzzle emerges when Jack finds an Airedale that looks just like his own dog, answers to the same name and turns out to belong to another boy, an explorer like Jack, who is revealed to be Jack's identical twin, separated at birth. The factual descriptions of the swamp habitat and the fantastic elements of the plot cancel each other out, collapsing the quasi-mythic underpinnings of this quest for discovery.

Wyeth&#39;s Pilgrims</h2><p>The adventurous saga of the settling of the Plymouth Colony is strikingly portrayed in this magnificent book. Spectacular paintings by renowned artist N.C. Wyeth, gloriously bring to life the carefully researched text by well known children's book author Robert San Souci. The story of the Pilgrims, including the first Thanksgiving, is a central part of America's history and, over the course of time, it has taken on an almost mythical quality. Drawing upon a variety of resources, including the author's trip to the Plimouth Plantation, the text dispels some popular misconceptions about the setting of our nation as it broadens our understanding of the bravery and determination of our forebears. A beautiful artbook as well as an informative history book, <i>N.C Wyeth's Pilgrims</i> belongs in every home, library, and classroom.</p><p>Robert D. San Souci has retold numerous traditional tales and legends, including The Talking Egg , and The Faithful Friend , both of which received Caldecott Honors and Coretta Scott King Honors. He lives in Northern California.<br><br>N.C. Wyeth is renowned for his illustrations of children's classics like Treasure Island, Robin Hood, and The Last of the Mohicans. The paintings used to illustrate this book are from a series of murals commissioned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Compa<p>--<i>THE HORN BOOK MAGAZINE,</i> December 1991<br> <i>N. C. Wyeth's Pilgrims</i> consists of portions of murals Wyeth did for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1940; a fine text by Robert San Souci; and superlative production by Chronicle Books. Wyeth's restored colors glow with incomparable crystalline brilliance. As a history buff living close to Plymouth, I am delighted with San Souci's straightforward telling of the story. He skirts myth and legend without losing any of the romance or the achievement of that band of "Separatists and Strangers." Though there were no cattle in Plymouth at the time of the first Thanksgiving, as San Souci points out, the cover showing Wyeth's painting of a pilgrim maid riding a garland-bedecked cow is irresistible.<br> </p><p>--<i>BOOKLIST,</i> October 15, 1991<br> Stunning reproductions of Wyeth's murals of the Plymouth Colony (commissioned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the 1940s) are combined with San Soud's clear; succinct text in a beautiful new offering. Using the writings of William Bradford as well as authoritative sources from the Plimoth Plantation, San Souci skillfully describes the journy of the Separatists and the Strangers (later known collectively as the Pilgrims) aboard the Mayflower to the New World. He also chronicles the hardships endured during their first year in America and the preparations for the frst Thanksgiving. In an afterword, San Souci is careful to note a few unintentional errors in Wyeth's paintings (for example, cows were not brought to Plymouth until 1624, and the Pilgrims did not always wear somber clothing). A second note explains the background behind Wyeth's paintings. The text has been boxed to set it off from the full-color artwork, making this a handsome as well as an informative book. Reminiscent of Marda Sewall's <i>Pilgrims of Plimoth,</i> the book will be a welcome addition to libraries.<br> </p><p>--<i>SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL</i><br> Wyeth's 14-panel mural of the early Pilgrim years, done for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company building in the early 1940s, has been handsomely reproduced (although never in its entirety) to accompany a spare but aesthetically appealing recitation of the legends of Myles Standish, Squanto, and the anticlimactic "First Thanksgiving." The figures are solidly rendered, as if cut from Plymouth's rocky soil, and wear the expected white collars, flowing capes, bonnets, and high-crowned hats. Readers are offered broad vistas, in keeping with mural design, but also closeups of significant objects like a full-sailed Mayflower or a flirtatious maid at her spinnmg wheel. The overall visual effect is softly upbeat and romantic. Even winter snow-scenes are suffused with a heavenly light that must surely symbolize success. If this visual version of the Pilgrims is much more myth than fact, so what? The endpapers reproduce the Mayflower's passenger list that records the many deaths, remarriages, and births of the early years, ignored in Wyeth's paintings. San Souci's text, mostly unrelated to the pictures, does provide a modicum of information about the reasons for the flight from England and some of the events involved with producing a settlement. These bits of the record can be found in many other histories. What makes this book special is that it is to be experienced as a healthy fairly tale told with artistic poetency and a strong sense of the human scale of the history.<br> <br><br><br>Stunning reproductions of N.C.

Jerusalem awaits the invasion of the crusaders who have surrounded the city&#x2019;s gates. There, inside the ancient city&#x2019;s walls, men and women of every age and every faith have gathered to hear the wise words of a mysterious man known only as the Copt. He has summoned the townspeople to address their fears with truth:&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;Tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to war. . . . None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside.

Therefore, we will speak about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br> The people begin with questions about defeat, struggle, and the nature of their enemies; they contemplate the will to change and the virtues of loyalty and solitude; and they ultimately turn to questions of beauty, love, wisdom, sex, elegance, and what the future holds. &#x201c;What is success?&#x201d; poses the Copt. &#x201c;It is being able to go to bed each night with your soul at peace.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> * &nbsp;* &nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, these many centuries later, the wise man&#x2019;s answers are a record of the human values that have endured throughout time. And, in Paulo Coelho&#x2019;s hands, <i>The Manuscript Found in Accra</i> reveals that who we are, what we fear, and what we hope for the future come from the knowledge and belief that can be found within us, and not from the adversity that surrounds us.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br></p></p><p>One of the most influential writers of our time, Paulo Coelho is the author of many international best sellers, including&nbsp;<i>The Alchemist,</i>&nbsp;<i>Aleph,</i>&nbsp;<i>Eleven Minutes,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Pilgrimage</i>.

I am only twenty-one, my parents gave me love and an education, and I married a woman I love and who loves me in return. However, tomorrow, life will undertake to separate us, and we must each set off in search of our own path, our own destiny or our own way of facing death.<br><br>As far as our family is concerned, today is the fourteenth of July, 1099. For the family of Yakob, the childhood friend with whom I used to play in this city of Jerusalem, it is the year 4859&#x2014;he always takes great pride in telling me that Judaism is a far older religion than mine. For the worthy Ibn al-Athir, who spent his life trying to record a history that is now coming to a conclusion, the year 492 is about to end. We do not agree about dates or about the best way to worship God, but in every other respect we live together in peace.<br><br>A week ago, our commanders held a meeting. The French soldiers are infinitely superior and far better equipped than ours. We were given a choice: to abandon the city or fight to the death, because we will certainly be defeated. Most of us decided to stay.<br><br>The Muslims are, at this moment, gathered at the Al-Aqsa mosque, while the Jews choose to assemble their soldiers in Mihrab Dawud, and the Christians, who live in various different quarters, are charged with defending the southern part of the city.<br><br>Outside, we can already see the siege towers built from the enemy&#x2019;s dismantled ships. Judging from the enemy&#x2019;s movements, we assume that they will attack tomorrow morning, spilling our blood in the name of the Pope, the &#x201c;liberation&#x201d; of the city, and the &#x201c;divine will.&#x201d;<br><br>This evening, in the same square where, a millennium ago, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate handed Jesus over to the mob to be crucified, a group of men and women of all ages went to see the Greek, whom we all know as the Copt.<br><br>The Copt is a strange man. As an adolescent, he decided to leave his native city of Athens to go in search of money and adventure. He ended up knocking on the doors of our city, close to starvation. When he was well received, he gradually abandoned the idea of continuing his journey and resolved to stay.<br><br>He managed to find work in a shoemaker&#x2019;s shop, and&#x2014;just like Ibn al-Athir&#x2014;he started recording every- thing he saw and heard for posterity. He did not seek to join any particular religion, and no one tried to persuade him otherwise. As far as he is concerned, we are not in the years 1099 or 4859, much less at the end of 492. The Copt believes only in the present moment and what he calls Moira&#x2014;the unknown god, the Divine Energy, responsible for a single law, which, if ever broken, will bring about the end of the world.<br><br>Alongside the Copt were the patriarchs of the three religions that had settled in Jerusalem. No government official was present during this conversation; they were too preoccupied with making the final preparations for a resistance that we believe will prove utterly pointless.<br><br>&#x201c;Many centuries ago, a man was judged and condemned in this square,&#x201d; the Greek said. &#x201c;On the road to the right, while he was walking toward his death, he passed a group of women. When he saw them weeping, he said: &#x2018;Weep not for me, weep for Jerusalem.&#x2019; He prophesied what is happening now. &#x2018;From tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to a war that will last into an unimaginably distant future.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>No one said anything, because none of us knew exactly why we were there. Would we have to listen to yet another sermon about these invaders calling themselves &#x201c;crusaders&#x201d;?<br><br>For a moment, the Copt appeared to savor the general confusion. And then, after a long silence, he explained:<br><br>&#x201c;They can destroy the city, but they cannot destroy everything the city has taught us, which is why it is vital that this knowledge does not suffer the same fate as our walls, houses, and streets. But what is knowledge?&#x201d;<br><br>When no one replied, he went on:<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t the absolute truth about life and death, but the thing that helps us to live and confront the challenges of day-to-day life. It isn&#x2019;t what we learn from books, which serves only to fuel futile arguments about what happened or will happen; it is the knowledge that lives in the hearts of men and women of good will.&#x201d;<br><br>The Copt said:<br><br>&#x201c;I am a learned man, and yet, despite having spent all these years restoring antiquities, classifying objects, recording dates, and discussing politics, I still don&#x2019;t know quite what to say to you. But I will ask the Divine Energy to purify my heart. You will ask me questions, and I will answer them. That is what the teachers of Ancient Greece did; their disciples would ask them questions about problems they had not yet considered, and the teachers would answer them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what shall we do with your answers?&#x201d; someone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some will write down what I say. Others will remember my words. The important thing is that tonight you will set off for the four corners of the world, telling others what you have heard. That way, the soul of Jerusalem will be preserved. And one day, we will be able to rebuild Jerusalem, not just as a city, but as a center of knowledge and a place where peace will once again reign.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We all know what awaits us tomorrow,&#x201d; said another man. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to discuss how to negotiate for peace or prepare ourselves for battle?&#x201d;<br><br>The Copt looked at the other religious men beside him and then immediately turned back to the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside. Our task is not to leave a record of what happened on this date for those who will inherit the Earth; history will take care of that. Therefore, we will speak about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face. That is all the future will be interested in, because I do not believe very much will change in the next thousand years.&#x201d;</p><h2>Teen Titans: Family Lost</h2><p>Raven returns...with a new body, but also a new master: the latest Brother Blood!

Challenging accepted modes of painting, Abstract Expressionists produced highly experimental works that jolted the public out of its postwar complacency. Susan Landauer's comprehensive examination of this dynamic movement provides the first clear picture of the artists and influences that came together in San Francisco's invigorating world of Abstract Expressionism.<br><br>Landauer argues that Abstract Expressionism resulted from a broad collective impulse rather than the inspiration of a small band of New York artists. Documenting the interchanges between the East and West Coasts, she cites areas of mutual influence and shows the impact of San Francisco on the New York School, including artists such as Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt. San Francisco's Beat poets, Dixieland jazz musicians, and the area's stunning vistas were essential parts of Abstract Expressionism, as were artistic and spiritual contacts with Asia.<br><br>Under Douglas MacAgy and Clyfford Still, the California School of Fine Arts became the undisputed center of vanguard abstraction on the West Coast. Artists such as Edward Corbett, Jay DeFeo, James Budd Dixon, Frank Lobdell, and Hassel Smith produced gritty, provocative images whose impact extended well beyond California. Landauer also notes the importance of Grace L. McCann Morley, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, who opened the museum to major Abstract Expressionist figures, and Jermayne MacAgy, who brought local and international artists together.<br><br>Enlivened by oral histories, Landauer's book is a rewarding exploration of a vital period in modern art. Richly illustrated with 96 color plates, it celebrates the energy and lasting impact of a special time.</p><p>"This well written, fully researched, and handsomely illustrated volume gives potent new life to artists and ideas nearly lost to American art history.

It took a year to accumulate enough so that one could actually see it. Now so much has been produced that we don't know what to do to get rid of it. We have created a monster.</p><p>The history of plutonium is as strange as the element itself. When scientists began looking for it, they did so simply in the spirit of inquiry, not certain whether there were still spots to fill on the periodic table. But the discovery of fission made it clear that this still-hypothetical element would be more than just a scientific curiosity-it could be the main ingredient of a powerful nuclear weapon.</p><p>As it turned out, it is good for almost nothing else. Plutonium's nuclear potential put it at the heart of the World War II arms race-the Russians found out about it through espionage, the Germans through independent research, and everybody wanted some. Now it is warehoused around the world-the United States alone possesses about forty-seven metric tons-but it has almost no practical use outside its role in nuclear weaponry. How did the product of scientific curiosity become such a dangerous burden?</p><p>In his history of this complex and dangerous element, noted physicist Jeremy Bernstein describes the steps that were taken to transform plutonium from a laboratory novelty into the nuclear weapon that destroyed Nagasaki. This is the first book to weave together the many strands of plutonium's story, explaining not only the science but also the people involved.</p></p><p>"None of Jeremy Bernstein's devoted New Yorker readers were surprised that he brought J. Robert Oppenheimer to life in his compelling biography, <i>Oppenheimer: Portrait of an Enigma</i>. But bringing plutonium to life-making the 94th element as interesting as 'the father of the atomic bomb'-is science writing that borders on literary magic."-Martin J. Sherwin, coauthor of <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer</i>, winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography<p>Jeremy Bernstein was a staff writer at the New Yorker for thirty-five years and is Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology.

The text is intended for senior/graduate level courses in probability and stochastic processes, and is aimed at students in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and physics. With its excellent topical coverage, the book can be used for two or three different courses. This significantly updated fourth edition now includes a coauthor, Prof. S. Unnikrishna Pillai, also from Polytechnic.</p><p>This text is a classic in probability, statistics, and estimation and in the application of these fields to modern engineering problems. <i>Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes</i> assumes a strong college mathematics background. The first half of the text develops the basic machinery of probability and statistics from first principles while the second half develops applications of the basic theory. Topics in the first section include probability distributions and densities, random variables and vectors, expectations, covariance, correlations, functions of random variables and vectors, and conditional distributions and densities. In this third edition of the text, the second half of the book has been substantially updated and expanded to include new or revised discussions of the following topics: mean square estimation, likelihood tests, maximum entropy methods, Monte Carlo techniques, spectral representations and estimation, sampling theory, bispectra and system identification, cyclostationary processes, deterministic signals in noise, and the Wiener and Kalman filters. <i>Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes</i> covers a remarkable density of material and the clarity of both presentation and notation make this book invaluable as a text and a reference.S. Unnikrishna Pillai is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, New York.

Featuring an impeccably selected group of about sixty dresses from many of the most eminent fashion houses, the book is a celebratory tribute to the iconic little black dress and its deeply resonant cultural and social significance in the modern era.<br><br> Defined by the simplest parameters&#x2014;color and shape&#x2014;yet voluminous in possibility, the little black dress is personalized by the designer who imagined it and the woman who wears it. In one silhouette it can capture a woman's allure, and in one evening worn provide her with a reservoir of memories. It can sum up in one wardrobe reconnaissance the way you wore the way you were. A little black dress in any other color could dent a reputation; in black it can only elevate one. Whether made from the most superior fabrics, or designed in cutting-edge neoprene, the little black dress maintains its status as the game-changer, the free spirit and pleasure-seeker (Audrey Hepburn in Givenchy in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>), the career-launcher (Elizabeth Hurley in Versace), the going-for-broke risk-taker (Virginie Gautreau as Madame X), inevitably revealing truths about the women who have chosen to wear one.<br><br> Three original essays offer personal histories in praise of the little black dress. An introduction by Andr� Leon Talley and a foreword by Paula Wallace complete this exquisite volume. Together with a stunning collection of images, this book presents a singularly elegant portfolio.</p><p><b>Andre Leon Talley</b> began his career assisting Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute and later wrote for <i>Interview Magazine</i> and <i>Women's Wear Daily</i>, before joining <i>Vogue</i>, where he served as creative director, editor-at-large, and contributing editor for many years.

First published in 1892, &#34;Blackfoot Lodge Tales&#34; is based on George Bird Grinnell&#39;s extensive personal knowledge of the three tribes of the Blackfoot nation. Grinnell, an ethnologist, writer, editor, explorer, creator of Glacier National Park, and protector of Yellowstone National Park, had great compassion for and understanding of Indians at a time when most men of the frontier were both uninterested in and unable to record the Indians&#39; oral literature. The Blackfoot nation recognized Grinnell as an invaluable friend and entrusted their heritage to his keeping. With that in mind, Grinnell presents as the first half of his book thirty stories of the Blackfeet, recorded as they were told to him - stories of war and adventure, ancient times, natural phenomena, origins of social customs, and tales of creation and the Creator. The remainder of the book deals with the history of the Blackfeet, their daily life and customs, tribal organization, and religion. &#39;The book is delightful for its presentation of a people whose honest expressions are recorded in all the freshness of their unpolluted, unrefined state. Reading them, one can...smell the Buffalo grass and the wood fires, feel the heavy morning dew on the prairie&#39; - &#34;Western American Literature&#34;.</p><p>"The author&#x2019;s observations of the social organization, daily life, and customs of [the Blackfoot] rounds out a singular book."&#x2014;Los Angeles Times. "Grinnell&#x2019;s book has stood the test of time as an important contribution to the history and ethnography of the Blackfeet."&#x2014;Natural History. <p>"A classic collection of tales by a gifted storyteller and a lucid ethnographic description of the Blackfeet."&#x2014;Studies in American Indian Literature. </p><p>This collection of powerful stories reveals the complex and wondrous world of the Blackfoot nation in the nineteenth century. The thirty tales transcribed by George Bird Grinnell provide an intimate look into Blackfoot culture and philosophy and remind us of tribal values to be upheld and taught. Classic tales of adventure speak of deeds accomplished, and cultural heroes roam across an arresting Native landscape of legend and history. Ancient stories, captured in oral tradition, cast the shadow of the Blackfoot people far into the past and provide foundation and meaning for their lives in the present. The final section of this book is an insightful overview of the history and culture of the Blackfoot Nation. First published in 1892, Blackfoot Lodge Tales is based on George Bird Grinnell&#x2019;s personal interactions with the Blackfoot people. </p><p>A member of the Blackfeet Tribe and a historian, Thedis Berthelson Crowe provides an indigenous perspective of the Blackfoot Lodge Tales in her new introduction to this edition. Her great-great grandfather, William Russell, served as the Blackfoot interpreter for Grinnell.</p>George Bird Grinnell was a man of diverse talents editor, author, traveler, and scientist. Born in 1849, he became, by turn of the century, one of the best-known and most popular interpreters of the American Indian.</p><h2>My Queer War</h2><p>A POWERFUL STORY OF SEXUAL AWAKENING DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR FROM THE NOTED MEMORIST AND CRITIC In My Queer War, James Lord tells the story of a young man&#x20ac;&#x2122;s exposure to the terrors, dislocations, and horrors of armed conflict. In 1942, a timid, inexperienced twenty-one-year-old Lord reports to Atlantic City, New Jersey, to enlist in the U.S. Army. His career in the armed forces takes him to Nevada and California, to Boston, to England, and eventually to France and Germany, where he witnesses firsthand the ravages of total war on Europe&#x20ac;&#x2122;s land and on its people. Along the way he comes to terms with his own sexuality, experiences the thrill of first love and the chill of disillusionment with his fellow man, and in a moment of great rashness makes the acquaintance of the world&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most renowned artist, who will show him the way to a new life. My Queer War is a rich and moving record of one man&#x20ac;&#x2122;s maturation in the</p><p>JAMES LORD's books include <i>A Giacometti Portrait</i>, first published in 1965, and <i>Giacometti: A Biography </i>(FSG, 1985), which was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His most recent work is <i>Mythic Giacometti </i>(FSG, 2003).<i>One</i>NOVEMBER 1942 <p>It all began beside the war-torn sea. In Atlantic City. Truly a queer setting�&#x20ac;&#x201d;out of place for an epic adventure, let alone a good venue for making a young man ready to perform the daredevil feats of wartime avaiators. Yet this second-rate, overbuilt resort had been dreamed up like the locus of a psychedelic fantasy by the U.S. Army Air Force for the basic training of would-be fliers into the wild blue yonder. All the Xanadu pleasure domes left vacant by wartime retrenchment were thought well suited for billeting transient thousands of glassy-eyed rookies. Of the derelict hotels having survived the Great Depression, not to mention the Panic of �&#x20ac;&#x2122;93, the flakiest was the Chelsea, a dilapidated pile of enthralling ugliness set at the seedy end of the celebrated boardwalk.</p><p>Along those damp and treacherous planks that dreary November afternoon slouched a sullen troop of soldiers. I was one of them: a college dropout, single, aged nineteen, and white, number 12183139, brown of hair and eye, with a straight nose, sensuous mouth, slightly protuberant chin, average of height, weight, build, unremarkable, in short, in every outward aspect.</p><p>Which was wholly to the good. Being unremarkable in that ragtag rabble of GIs, all attired exactly alike, I ran no risk of betraying my lurid, shaming, guilty secret. Never mind that by a blatant lie I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d already betrayed civic decency by putting on the U.S. Army�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s uniform. But I could chalk that up to poetic license. Writing was already my good excuse for almost anything that needed excusing. Much did.</p><p>How it happened that I had become a private in Flight B of the 989th TSS was a poor joke, a joke, indeed, so furiously unfunny that it dwelt by itself as an existential black hole. Anyway, I marched laboriously against the icy winds beneath the oncoming dusk toward our billet in the Hotel Chelsea. Only eleven days in uniform then, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d dropped out of college just three weeks before under the flimsiest of pretenses. Pretense, indeed, promised to be permanent military apparel, within which I could feast upon discontent, a disguise, moreover, expected to fool everyone but which, of course, made me misfortune�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s fool.</p><p>The lobby of the Chelsea smelled of old age, sewage, and soldiers�&#x20ac;&#x2122; sweat. A slovenly sergeant materialized from the staircase and ordered us to get our asses into a room, any room on the floors above and double up snap on the spot with anybody willing, two rooks to a room, two cots, two footlockers, and no shit.</p><p>Such an unprecedented option offered a hint of potential companionship on the spur of the moment. The army experience, after all, advertised its facility for creating buddies, the happenstance of warfare famous for forging bonds between men, having, in fact, made heroes of soldiers embracing each other in foxholes while the gentle rain of shrapnel burst above them in the vivid air.</p><p>Across the smelly crowd in the hotel lobby I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d already spotted a good-looking GI lost in the middle distance, and I thought, Why not? He was wonderfully fair, features almost too fine, a Botticelli of angelic allure, tall and slender. He was apparently unaccompanied as yet by any makeshift pals, so I kept close behind on the cramped upstairs climb. When he lurched under the ungainly duffel bag into a room on the malodorous third floor, I was at his heels before a rival could crowd in.</p><p>Hopping aside from the thudding fall of his duffel bag, he flung himself across the cot beside the window. I took the place by the door and waited, companionably leaving to him the prerogative of greetings. My wait while I waited extended ever so slowly beyond titillating anticipation as he lay like a heap of oblivion, absent eyes fixed on nothing. I breathed in and breathed out for what it was worth, and evidently it wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t worth much, because the roommate of my optimistic expectation soon seemed, in reality, as much like thin air as thin air itself.</p><p>Eventually, however, he hawked and spit out, �&#x20ac;&#x153;This dump eats shit.�&#x20ac; </p><p>An observation, if you like, well taken, and in accent native to the outlying reaches of New York City. Thus angelic Botticelli immediately matured into a Caravaggio boy of the streets. No overture to conversation, of course. But there I was, and I <i>was</i> there and had to say so. Timidly standing, tentatively taking steps in the direction of camaraderie, I held down my hand and said, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Hi. Name�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Jim Lord. Guess we�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d better get acquainted.�&#x20ac; </p><p>He squinted, shifted, scowled, steely about the gray eyes, ignoring the presumptuous hand, then at last, however, snarled, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Teves. Joe Teves.�&#x20ac; </p><p>�&#x20ac;&#x153;Okay,�&#x20ac; I said, swallowing the shame of hostility.</p><p>So he must have known. Known without knowledge, without understanding, yet with the sly menace of the male of the species. God knows beasts can be beautiful. And beauty can bedevil the best of precautions. Still, how, but <i>how</i>, could I have betrayed the lonely and loathsome self of that ghastly thunderclap of awareness in the grim dusk of October adolescence? The streak of pain vibrated also in the stagnant confine of that catastrophic hotel, the very vibration being surely what I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d come there for. For which, indeed, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d volunteered to forsake Kierkegaard and Kafka, offering to the future an aptitude for matters of guilt.</p><p>My roommate, needless to say, never became my friend, much less a buddy, barely an acquaintance. Good looks went bad in a hurry. Botticelli, Caravaggio all mutated almost overnight into Hieronymus Bosch. As we became ensnared in reciprocal contempt, such words as were spitefully breathed back and forth had only to do with mops, washrags, and the danger of dirt. He promptly found a flock of pals with whom to chew the fat, numbers like himself from the wrong side of the Harlem River, none of whom even offered me a cigarette. Anyway, I didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t smoke. How gladly, however, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d have nursed a clandestine bottle of Four Roses.</p><p>At my hateful college I used to carry a pint around the campus in a paper bag. This earned a scolding from the dean and worsened the sniffiness of classmates whose scrutiny I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d hoped to divert from inner affliction and focus upon the outer distinction of one who dared to live with a difference. This was no good, and rather worse than that, so I consequently hated the college and everyone in it with a passion almost equal to the loathing I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d felt for myself ever since that terrible twilight. Walking back to the prep school dorm after my piano lesson, with Beethoven�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Rondo resonant still, along the cement sidewalk strewn with dead leaves, I suddenly saw like an appalling sunburst, fatal and final, that what I really wanted to do with the good-looking boys whose best pal I longed to be was not just horsing around in the locker room but doing freely with them in bed after lights out everything I had always till then been compelled to do in solitude with myself. In short, the creature I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d suddenly seen was that abnormal, that abominable thing called a homosexual, a loathsome mistake of nature, a cultural criminal whom any feeling person would naturally put in prison. So I vowed I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d never, <i>ever</i> succumb to the vile desires roused by those football-playing jocks and their curly-haired cheerleaders.</p><p>You might think that to wake up gay is no big deal. If you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re straight, you certainly would. But be the spoiled son of a creationist family, whether in Memphis, Montevideo, or Madras, and your wake-up dream is a nightmare of hopeless craving to get into the pants of a pretty sailor, and you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re doomed to a lifetime of disgusting torment. Mind you, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;m talking about a Massachusetts prep school in �&#x20ac;&#x2122;38. Nowadays everything�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s supposed to be okay; congressmen and ambassadors boast of boyfriends. And yet . . . parents in Dallas, Dijon, or Dar es Salaam hardly hope that their kids will grow up to live in sin with same-sex partners and maybe�&#x20ac;&#x201d;even day after tomorrow�&#x20ac;&#x201d;would disown them if they did.</p><p>It was all very well to hate college and despise those alluring fraternity brothers in their varsity sweaters. But how the hell was I going to get out of there? The fix�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and its suppositious remedy�&#x20ac;&#x201d;were of a character to confound the authors of <i>Either/Or</i>, <i>The Castle</i>, and then some. I sat down at my university desk in the windy, irrational recklessness of that October 1942 and wrote to my parents a letter that I thought both purposeful and tricky, leaving at the same time, I felt, no loophole for the trick to be turned on me, suggesting, intimating that maybe�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>maybe!</i>�&#x20ac;&#x201d;it might be worthwhile to ponder the possibility that I <i>might</i> volunteer for the army, in the uncertain interim leave college so as to peacefully think things over. And wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t I already a writer, after all, my senior thesis at prep school having, indeed, been a biography of Beethoven? Oh, yes, I <i>was</i> already a writer, needing to learn how words can make fools of those who set out to toy with them. Meaning�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s not meant to be the plaything of understanding. The trick was promptly and fatefully turned, while I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d thought myself an ingenuous young fellow out of some story by Thomas Mann, a Tonio Kröger-to-be.</p><p>Mom and Dad wrote by return mail, approving and praising my manly decision and idealistic self-sacrifice at this time of peril for our homeland. So I had unwittingly made ready for a future that would turn out to be the lunatic destination of my dearest dreams.</p><p>That overcast morning, Thursday, November 5, 1942, I plodded alongside my proud father to the United States Army recruitment center on Lexington Avenue in New York City, prepared to go through with the military make-believe no matter what it cost. Nor did the nitwit eventuality of risking one�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s life in defense of the nation provide an instant�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s pause. So I went inside to sacrifice my liberty, not to mention the pursuit of happiness, in order to combat infamy and evil throughout the world.</p><p>The fitness inspection for this noble purpose took place amid a joshing and jostling crowd of stark-naked rookies-to-be. The lavish vision of so many penises might have been exciting to a homo. It wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t. Disturbing, rather, and alarming. Malaise begotten by ice-cold fear of excitement�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s danger. After the hypodermics and the rude, crude medics, the rectal plus the genital intrusions, show your teeth, fingernails, metatarsal arches, blink your fucking eyes, take a deep breath, and you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re face-to-face with the ultimate question mark of manliness: a blasé, believe-it-or-not lieutenant psychiatrist says, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Do you like girls?�&#x20ac; Or prefer confinement in a federal penitentiary for the remainder of your unnatural life, sexual leprosy not wanted, queers unfit to honor the flag of their forebears. And I, to tell the truth, had known a couple of likable girls, so I said, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Yes. Yes, sir.�&#x20ac; </p><p>As a volunteer I was privileged to choose among the army�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s prestigious outfits the one in which I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d be most honored to serve. I said, �&#x20ac;&#x153;The air force.�&#x20ac; A sergeant callously recorded my choice on a piece of paper, as if no daring defiance of gravity were called for, and that was how I set out upon everyman�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s career in space. Anyway, I�&#x20ac;&#x2122;d never been up in an airplane. So I was made ready for basic training as a wearer of wings. This was basic, in point of fact, to survival. Not entirely physical but very psychic. You were about to be manufactured as a numbered machine wearing a uniform, marching up and down, back and forth, around and around, here and there, fast and slow according to instructions for the futility of the function and not meant to be a state of being, snap to it or you�&#x20ac;&#x2122;re dead on your feet. Teves�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s ilk loved it. I was at its mercy, of which there was none.</p><p>My nemesis was a beer-bellied gorilla named Sullivan, slave driver of the parade ground, a regular army master sergeant. This ape was called Bathwater Sullivan because a marcher�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s slightest misstep brought forth jungle roaring: �&#x20ac;&#x153;Keep in step, you clumsy motherfucker, or it�&#x20ac;&#x2122;ll be your bathwater.�&#x20ac; Personal hygiene being odorously negligible for the simian sergeant, one wondered. Had this demented primate been traumatized by an overdose of H2O or was he merely a bestial Bible Belter obsessed by John the Baptist�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s bathtub? The unwashed sarge, in any case, was a certifiable shit with a savage aptitude for bullying, fortified by the flair of a born-again sadist for spotting <i>the</i> rookie most vulnerable to vicious ferocity. That from day one was me, and smelly Sully fell into the implacable habit of marching immediately beside me, bellowing his ape-man orders into my ear. TotheleftMAACH. TotherearMAACH. TotherightMAACH. RightleftrearMAACHand-MAACHandMAACH. And onthedoubleMAACH till your flat feet burn on the griddle of last year�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s pancakes, and every footfall falls into the furnace of fatigue, while Sullivan shouts, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Lift your lousy legs, Lord, you piss-poor fuckhead.�&#x20ac; </p><p>Out of every hour of torment, however, ten minutes�&#x20ac;&#x2122; blur of rest were allowed on the perimeter of nothingness. Virgil granting Dante an instant of surcease. No good to me, however, as I crouched apart from my platoon on the freezing slough of despond, often failing to stifle my malaise, stop the swell of tears, while such craven lack of backbone got laughed at by virile trainees glad to sneer at the absence of grit. And in the quagmire of self-pity stood nobody to turn to to console the feckless stumbler. Worse still was the fear that my lamentable lapse of restraint might betray to sturdier men-at-arms the guilty presence of a pansy weakling in their midst. So I had to be careful. This called for a devious bent, which I cultivated.</p><p>Marching was not the only initiation to the rudiments of hell on earth, though thanks to Bathwater, it became the most personal. There was plenty to make physical abjection pass for fun. From black dawn to blacker dusk. Starting with socket-wrenching calisthenics before you woke up. Prone on your belly under acres of barbed wire, you wriggled beneath make-believe bullets whizzing in the machine-gun breeze six inches above your butt, sergeants screaming, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Eat that dirt, you stinking cocksuckers.�&#x20ac; And you choked on it. Then climbing the walls of splintered planks prepared to rip raw your fingernails, sprawling on the far side onto frozen mud before you could dream of hoisting your carcass hand over hand up aching ropes into some kind of nonexistence. After the firing range your shoulder was bruised black and blue, eardrums drumming to deafen the afternoon. And none of that lunatic drill had the least fucking thing to do with flying. You were enslaved by the unfeeling earth and the cruel inhumanity of the watching ocean.</p><p>Worse was the gnawing solitude. In the midst of backslapping soldiery, in the mess hall, the toilets, shower room, out-of-doors and in, no one spoke to me, met my eye, agreed with my glance, or pretended I was anything like everybody else. Maybe that was the rightful consequence of my knowing I never would be. Still, one might have expected even as a desperate gesture of mutable fellow feeling that Teves would sometime speak of something more companionable than the sheen of dust beneath my cot. He never did.</p><p>The fool�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s gold of poetic license wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t the only palliative for self-pity. There was music too, melody, harmony, the metronome of solace. In one of the raddled ground-floor rooms of the Hotel Chelsea stood a decrepit upright piano, a moldering Mason and Hamlin, with its battered stool, a downcast survivor of prosperity�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s shipwreck. Still, it wasn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t too disastrously out of tune to play, only two keys, both black, missing. I delighted in this dishonored instrument, resorting to it with a soulful sense of deliverance whenever at l...</p></p><h2>Yoga: Awakening the Inner Body</h2><p>Written by an author who has practiced Iyengar-style yoga since 1971 and who studied with B. K. S. Iyengar himself, <i>Yoga: Awakening the Inner Body</i> is a thorough, up-to-date resource for students and teachers. Using questions such as "Do you have sloping shoulders or square-set shoulders?" and "Are the muscles at the back of your upper arms weak?" the book allows readers to tailor the instruction to fit their needs. Eight chapters cover everything from balancing the sternum to aligning the shoulder blades to exploring the relationship among the collarbone, kidneys, and groin. The book also features an introduction in which the author defines the inner body and the various stages of awakening and gives suggestions for using the book.</p><p>A yoga teacher since 1974, Donald Moyer has been practicing the Iyengar method of yoga since 1971. He is the founder and director of The Yoga Room in Berkeley, California, and is a former president of the California Yoga Teachers Association (CYTA).

When Grandpa Daniel was young, he tells his grandchild, his mother sent him to borrow some coals. His fear and courage in crossing the dark, dark wood is an old theme which this wonderful book makes accessible to contemporary young readers. The young Daniel acts out similes of bravery as he makes his way. Branches entrap him, slowing his progress, but he suddenly breaks free to move easily over the ground like a swift fox. Coming home he twists like a bobcat to free himself from a gnarled tree root and becomes the powerful big cat. Are these shape-shiftings real or metaphorical? The artist's strong paintings show the changes in stop motion and in dramatic wordless double pages, the animal stretching and springing forward. The light of Daniel's firebox contrasts dramatically with the rain-soaked dark. Readers and listeners are sure to find these detailed nature pictures fascinating. The text has been carefully placed within the pictures, resulting in an unusual unity that works to give the story a meaning on several levels. Fans of Yolen and Schoenherr's Owl Moon (Philomel, 1987) will like this, as will those at the upper end of the picture book age and a little beyond. Anna Biagioni Hart, Sherwood Regional Library, Alexandria, Va.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.When the stove goes out, young Daniel is sent to the neighbor's to get hot coals. The night is dark and foggy and Daniel is in a hurry to return home. As he runs through the woods, he stumbles, struggles to break free and discovers he has become a fleet-footed, silver-tailed fox. Later, he trips again and is transformed into a silent bobcat. Before he reaches home, however, Daniel meets a huge black grizzly bearand in place of his cat's paws are his own leather boots and mittened hands. He drops the coals on the ground and begins to shake. But once again, Daniel finds himself transformed, this time into a soaring eagle. Pittman weaves together fantasy and realism in a powerful story about conquering fear.

How can they push the medium beyond realism to build images that have urgency and power? Where can they seek informed advice and inspired motivation in pursuit of their art?<br>In Master Class in Watermedia - an updated full-color edition of his Master Class in Watercolor - renowned artist Edward Betts offers solutions to these and other provocative questions. Using his beautiful, luminous work as a point of departure, Betts invites painters who work in transparent watercolor, gouache, casein, acrylic, and mixed media to re-evaluate their materials, procedures, and approaches, and to take risks that will help them to abandon old habits and embrace fresh ways of seeing and painting.<br>Reviewing basic methods and exploring a variety of techniques, Betts first analyzes traditional sketching strategies (both on-location and in the studio), sources for pictorial images (including photographs, memory, reading, and studio experimentation), and the textures and effects obtainable in each of the watermedia. Collage, mixed-media, and brushless methods are considered as tools for expanding one's repertoire, and for gaining a deeper understanding of the formal possibilities of subject matter. Betts then assesses the complex relationships between nature and abstraction, from descriptive realism to pure design. Finally, readers are encouraged to evaluate their influences and work critically, and to appraise their creative strengths and weaknesses.<br>Intelligently written and lavishly illustrated with many new works done especially for this version, Master Class in Watermedia is an invaluable source of inspiration for intermediate and advanced watermedia artists.</p><p>Edward Betts is a professor emeritus of art at the University of Illinois.</p><h2>I Ching</h2><p>For three thousand years, people have sought personal insight and a window on the future from the I Ching, or the Book of Changes, the classic Chinese oracle and book of wisdom. Drawing on archeological findings, previously published only in Chinese, indicating how the I Ching was actually used by those who created it, and motivated by a lifetime of personal use and fascination, Kerson Huang has created a new translation of great significance. <br><br>Restoring the I Ching to its original form, Huang underscores its first use as a practical oracle by Chinese farmers. His translation beautifully preserves the starkly poetic voice of the original, while his comments clearly and simply explain the images and detail the historical references buried within the verse. Huang reveals the I Ching as an epic poem equivalent to <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>--one hexagram recalls the dethroning of Feng Feng; a series of lines portray Wang Hai, one of the three High Ancestors of the Shang dynasty; a third contains a sage proclamation of Lord Tang. <br><br>Each hexagram and its corresponding interpretation is presented on a two-page spread, making this version unusually easy to use and understand. Introductory chapters detail the evolution of the I Ching, from the philosophical reinterpretations of Confucius to the modern musings of Carl Jung, and clearly explain both the coin method and yarrow-stalk method for consulting the oracle. <br><br>Over 55,000 copies in print.</p><p>Three thousand years ago, the I Ching was created as a simple oracle, consulted by farmers and kings alike. Now, stripping away more than two millenia of interpretive distortion and dogma superimposed on the text by successive generations of scholars, world-renowned physicist Kerson Huang and his wife Rosemary have succeeded in restoring the book to its original form. <p> In this important new translation, the Huangs reveal the stark poetry of the authentic I Ching, reconstruct the numerous historical tales that were once an essential element of the text, and present the hexagrams and their judgements clearly and concisely. Most importantly, they allow the ancient classic to serve its intended purpose as a practical handbook for divination. </p><p> A professor of particle physics at MIT, Kerson Huang has been consulting the I Ching since his childhood in Canton. He brings to this work both a unique ability to bridge the cultures of East and West, and the fascinating perspective of the scientific mind confronting the great mysteries of the human soul. </p><p> "Rosemary and Kerson Huang, poet and physicist-poet, have made a superb translation and appreciation of the bone-old book." -Phillip Morrison, author of Powers of Ten</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Rosemary Huang has consulted the I Ching regularly and pursued her translation through years of research.</p><h2>Helping Others Find Freedom in Christ</h2><p>Helping Others Find Freedom in Christ Training Manual and Study Guide gives you an easy-to-use method for sharing the Steps to Freedom in Christ.

She smiled and patted me. &#x201c;You got reasons so many talking words in there.&#x201d; Then she tapped my head. Tap, tap, tap. &#x201c;Your mama filled your head up with stories. And Mistress petted you and taught you to read and to write.&#x201d; Then she said, &#x201c;Eliza, you are a child who is all filled up with words.&#x201d; I love when Abbey tells me these things. My arms are not long enough to wrap around Abbey&#x2019;s waist like I did with my mother. I wrap my arms tight around Abbey as far as they can go.<br><br>Then Abbey told me, &#x201c;You are not like me, Eliza.&#x201d; First this made me sad. She is all I have now. But my sadness did not linger for long. I became the happiest I can be!<br><br>&#x201c;Talk your words in this,&#x201d; she told me. That&#x2019;s when Abbey gave me Mistress&#x2019;s never-been-used writing diary. Mistress had thrown it out. She cannot see so well to write anymore. I am writing in it now. Abbey gave me two lead pencils, too.<br><br>&#x201c;Write your words in it. But do not ever let Sir see you do it,&#x201d; she warned me. I know what she means. It is unlawful for Slaves to read and write. Mistress does not but Sir enforces the Slave Laws to the letter. Sometimes I am so full of fear for writing in my little book. But I must write. It helps me to think and remember.<br><br><b><b><i>Sunday, February 12, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b><br><br>All day long I worked beside Abbey cleaning out the kitchen garden. Soon the ground will be warm enough to turn over. When we stopped I asked Abbey, &#x201c;Tell me your favorite story.&#x201d; But Abbey said, &#x201c;I cannot tell the stories the way your mother, Jane Mae, did. I never did learn them good enough to tell. I just know them good enough to know.&#x201d; When my mother, Jane Mae, was here, there was always a story to listen to. Back then, Abbey said, &#x201c;Jane Mae told the stories right, from the old way.&#x201d; Then Abbey did not speak for a long time. Finally she said to me, &#x201c;Eliza, you should tell the stories now . . . you your mother&#x2019;s daughter. Look at the picture pattern on your quilt, and remember how each one goes.&#x201d; And Abbey said something that made a smile come up. &#x201c;You already got them inside you.&#x201d; She poked my chest and tapped my head the same way my mother, Jane Mae, did. &#x201c;Remembering in your head and feeling in your heart tells you you always is loved, Eliza.&#x201d;<br><br><b><b><i>Wednesday, February 15, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b><br><br>This day brought too many chores. I did all my usual ones. The work was hard but I have strong hands. Every day I carry the firewood to the kitchen. I fetch hot water to fill two tubs for Sir and Mistress to bathe in; I fill a third for them to rinse off in. I do not spill a drop. I broom-sweep the floors. I peel potatoes and empty the rinds. I scour the pots. Then today Mistress said, &#x201c;Now, Eliza, you must wait on me since Caroline and Abbey cannot.&#x201d; Sir said Abbey and Caroline must help prepare the seed beds for the tobacco. Poor Abbey, she cannot stomach the bad smell from the tobacco, whether it is seedlings or the full-grown plants.<br><br>I had to serve Mistress&#x2019;s morning, afternoon, and evening meals in her room. Mistress is not the same, either, since we lost my mother. She was not always so friendly, and now she is much more sickly and more frail. Mistress is beginning to look like one of those long-necked white egret birds with yellow eyes that live at the river. Abbey says Mistress has always been sickly, and sickest in the winter months. Now that things will be warming soon, Abbey says her strength will come all the way back. I hope so; this sickness in her body is causing Mistress&#x2019;s eyes to go blind. Abbey says she reckons there is a whole lot in the world Mistress just don&#x2019;t want to see. I try to understand Abbey, but sometimes what she says is puzzlement to me. Still, Abbey said she would teach me to gather the herb from the forest and prepare the all-heal remedy. But I already know this. I want to tell Abbey I know where to find the best all-heal. Mama always said it is best for Mistress&#x2019;s ailments where it is wild in the deep woods. All my life my mother would take me to the woods with her to gather it. She taught me about plants and these things and what to do if I am ever lost in the woods. I will wait until Abbey&#x2019;s mind is eased from working with tobacco to remind her of this.<br><br><b><b><i>Monday, February 20, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b><br><br>This morning Sir said Abbey must do more tobacco. This makes her very vexed on Sir. She never wants to be around tobacco. When Abbey is most vexed on Sir, she speaks her mind to me. Today she said there is something I must know and always remember. I write it here so I will never forget. &#x201c;The Slave has to be two of they selves. One self belongs to Mistress and Sir. The other one belongs to you, Eliza.&#x201d; Then she tapped my chest. &#x201c;Keep that one hid. Do not ever let Sir see that one. Do not <i>ever let Sir know that Eliza is even alive.&#x201d; Abbey told me this so I can stay safe. Some of us are beaten, sold, or more&#x2014;much worse, than those who do not do this. And now, for the first time, my eyes are all the way open. I can see for myself what this is meaning.</i><br><br>This day Caroline&#x2019;s oldest boy, Abel, was sold away. I have heard Sir say all the time to Mistress, &#x201c;That boy do not know his place.&#x201d; Early this morning Caroline came to Sir crying. She begged Sir, &#x201c;Oh, Master, please do not take my boy from me!&#x201d; When Sir turned a deaf ear to her, she ran after the wagon. But before she could catch it, Mr. Forrnistock, the overseer, caught up to her on his horse. He landed three heavy blows across her shoulders with his piece of rawhide strap. She dropped to her knees crying. Then they dragged her off to her cabin. No telling how long she will be down from the Shock sick.<br><br>This filled me up with such fear. What will Sir think of me one day? I said this to Abbey. But Abbey said the mistress would protect me. My head wonders why Mistress would save me and not my beloved mother, Jane Mae? I know Abbey did all she could.<br><br><b><b><i>Tuesday, February 21, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b><br><br>Today my head is full of remembering. Caroline&#x2019;s Shock sickness made me remember my own. But Abbey says the past must stay the past. I try but the remembering keeps coming to the front of my mind. I think of that day Sir sold my mother away from here. Abbey said that was a mean trick Sir played on me.<br><br>Early that morning Sir had called for me. &#x201c;Eliza, you go on to town with Ezekiel.&#x201d; <i>Me?</i> I thought. Sir had never sent me to town with Ezekiel to get supplies before, even though I always wanted to go. Ezekiel always goes to town for Sir. He cares for the horses and carriages, too. At first I thought maybe Sir was turning nice, but there was no smile in his voice and his hard face looked about the same.<br><br>The sun was high and pretty in that bright blue sky. The way we go to town, we must pass the whitewash building. &#x201c;That is the Slave pen,&#x201d; Ezekiel said of the place where slaves come to wait to be sold. Ezekiel knows all about it. He talked and talked of it but I hummed so I did not have to hear.<br><br>When we came back from town, I carried a peppermint sweet in the hem of my skirt so it would not melt all the way from Mr. Riley&#x2019;s store. Mrs. Riley had gave two to me. I ate one; the other peppermint was to be a present to my mother. Sir disallows us to have pockets.<br><br>I ran from the wagon to the kitchen before Ezekiel had time to unload. I wanted to see my mother&#x2019;s face full of love. But I did not see her face at all. She was not in the kitchen yard. She was not in the kitchen. She was not tending Mistress. She was not where she was supposed to be with Abbey. It was just a mournful Abbey in the kitchen, stirring tears into Sir&#x2019;s stew. My mother was nowhere that I could find her. Then Abbey told me what had happened. &#x201c;Jane Mae is gone. Sir sold her off.&#x201d; I know Sir probably sent her to the whitewash pen that Ezekiel showed me. I started to run there, but Ezekiel caught me. That&#x2019;s all I remember, before I fell down sick.<br><br>That day, Abbey said Sir is not for truth. He speaks lies. He separates us and sells us away when he says he will not. Abbey said Sir is the worst of a master. Abbey <i>tried to soothe me with her words. But it is not words that I wanted. It was my mother. For how long I was down, I do not know. But when I awoke, Abbey and Mistress were at my side. Mistress said Abbey doctored me back to myself. When I think on this, it makes my sadness deep as the river. I do not want to be by myself all alone in the world without my mother, Jane Mae. Abbey said nobody slept well in the house for two days. Sir said Abbey put too much salt in his stew. He had a stomachache for a week. Mistress cried steadily. She loved my mother best. That was nearly about one year ago now.</i><br><br>The day I woke up, Abbey was still crying. I remembered my mother&#x2019;s voice, it saying, &#x201c;Be careful, my daughter, Eliza. But do not fear. You will never be lost from me.&#x201d; And then I remembered what Ezekiel said: &#x201c;Be like me, Eliza, and forget you even had a mama.&#x201d; But I knew I could not do that. I will not do that. And now that I have my little writing book, I can remember everything about Mama. And like Abbey says, I can remember her stories because they are inside me now. I will write them in my little book to remember them always. This is my favorite one:<br><br><i>Each day as the sun rose, a man set out to hunt. And every evening as the sun went down, he returned to his home and family with the prize of his hunt.</i><br><br><i>One day the man did not return. Another day came and another night went, but the man did not return. A week went by, then a month. About the seventh month, the seventh son was born to the man and his wife. His name was Asa. The boy grew in a fine way. There came a time when Asa began to talk. The first thing he said was &#x201c;Where is my papa?&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the eldest son. &#x201c;Where is our papa?&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;He should have come back a long time ago,&#x201d; said the second son.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Something must have happened,&#x201d; said the third.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;I saw him go toward the village,&#x201d; said the fourth son.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;I saw him go across the river,&#x201d; said the fifth.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;We should follow his footsteps to see if they will lead us to him,&#x201d; said the sixth son.</i><br><br><i>They walked deep into the forest. Finally they came to a clearing. There on the ground were the man&#x2019;s bones and rusted spear. Now they knew what had happened to him.</i><br><br><i>The first son stepped forward and said, &#x201c;I know how to put bones together.&#x201d; He put them together, each in the right place.</i><br><br><i>The second son said, &#x201c;I know how to cover the bones with flesh.&#x201d; He covered the bones just as they should be.</i><br><br><i>The third son said, &#x201c;I have the power to make blood flow through his veins.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The fourth son said, &#x201c;I can put back breath into his body.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The fifth son said, &#x201c;I can give the power to move.&#x201d; Sure enough the man opened his eyes. He stretched. He sat upright.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;I can give the power of speech,&#x201d; said the sixth son, and he did. The man had to do the rest on his own.</i><br><br><i>When it was all right, Asa hugged his papa for the first time.</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;It is time to go home,&#x201d; the man said to his sons.</i><br><br><i>The man&#x2019;s wife was most overjoyed to see her husband again. &#x201c;Something must be done to show how grateful we are to have you back in the land of the living,&#x201d; she said.</i><br><br><i>In thanks the man killed one of his best cows. There was a great feast for all in the village. Then he took the tail of the cow and braided it. He decorated it with beads and cowry shells. It was a fine and beautiful cow-tail switch. Everyone admired it. The man said, &#x201c;I will give it away to the one who did the most for me to bring me back to the land of the living.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The first son said, &#x201c;I am oldest; give it to me.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The second son said, &#x201c;I deserve it more.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The third son said, &#x201c;I should not be left out.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The fourth son said, &#x201c;Surely I deserve it.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The fifth son stood. &#x201c;My gift was best.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The sixth son said, &#x201c;I should have the cow-tail switch.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i>The man thought, but he did not think for long. &#x201c;I have decided,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I will give it to Asa because he did the most. He was the one who asked: &#x2018;Where is my papa?&#x2019; You see, a person is dead only when he is truly forgotten.&#x201d;</i><br><br>I know I could never do what Ezekiel said. I will always remember I have a mother and her name is Jane Mae.<br><br><b><b><i>Sunday, February 26, 1854<br>Alexandria, Virginia</i></b></b><br><br>Today Sir was on the warpath. He made me so full of fear. When it was time to sleep Abbey asked me how come I do not write in my little book? I told her I have nothing to say to it. Abbey knows me better than that. She said, &#x201c;You remember Sir is early to bed and late to rise, Eliza. These are two good times that Sir would not even pay attention to you.&#x201d; Now I see I have so much to say.

Millions of people from all walks of life are experiencing a deep change in awareness, an experience marked by a new sense of well-being, and increasing joy in life, a diminishing of fear &#x2014; including fear of death &#x2014; and a natural impulse to serve the world in a real way. The Translucent Revolution describes this awakening and offers readers ample opportunities to cultivate and encourage the qualities of translucence in their own lives. Drawing from a highly convincing body of evidence, observations from pioneers in the field of human consciousness, and a vast pool of powerful stories, the book explores the effects of translucence on many aspects of contemporary western life, including personal relationships, sex, parenting, education, psychotherapy, medicine, aging, business, and global politics.</p><p>At a time when the fate of the world seems increasingly uncertain, <i>The Translucent Revolution</i> provides a compelling and convincing argument that radical positive change is taking place throughout our global society, resulting in increasing numbers of people from diverse and divergent backgrounds who are awakening to a state Ardagh defines as "translucent." In the process, they are becoming part of a potentially critical mass of people capable of triggering a worldaround awakening of deeper purpose, joy, compassion, self-fulfillment, and service to others. <p> Ardagh studied this "translucent revolution" for more than a decade, after years of spiritual seeking that culminated in his own awakening of his true inner state of being after famed spiritual teacher H.W. L. Poonja asked him, "Who is the one trying to be free? Who are you really?" What he subsequently discovered was that experiencing his inner awakening was far easier than living and maintaining it, but in the years since, he discovered ways of doing so, finding in the process that many others around the globe are now doing so as well. </p><p> As part of his research for The Translucent Revolution, Ardagh interviewed others from all walks of life he are awakening to similar experiences, including Ram Dass, Eckhart Tolle, Jean Houston, and Neale Donald Walsch. In all, he interviewed over 170 people, compiling 250 tapes and 3,000 pages of transcripts, the essence of which he distilled into this book. After opening with an examination of what "translucence" is and how it can be lived after the radical awakening that leads to it, Ardagh then explores how translucence can positively transform individuals in terms of their self-identity, personal actions, feelings, relationships, sexual partnering, parenting, and art. From there he examines the affects of translucence in collective society in terms of education, business, health care, religion, and global sense of community. Throughout the book, he provides readers with many experiential exercises they can do, both in the form of "Try It Yourself" exhortations and gentler "Nudges" that can be performed individually and with a partner. The end result is a doorway to a transformational journey that literally leaps off the written page.--<i>Larry Trivieri</i></p>When I started to write this book, I had not the faintest idea just how wide spread this phenomenon was. Now, having interviewed mainstream business and education consultants, people deep within the organized Christian church, and emminent medical doctors and psychotherapists who are awake and talking the language of translucence, I know that this is a golbal epedemic of sanity. The human race is waking up very fast, we are shifting from Homo sapiens to Homo illuminatus.

And he did become a cowboy and a doctor, and a psychologist, and a highly regarded anthropologist. However, it was as a writer that he ultimately found his true calling. His stories uniquely represented the bohemian sensibility of the time, and he was known for infusing intellectualism into his coyote tales and shamanic mysticism. So vivid were his tales that Ezra Pound called him the American Ovid,&#x201d; and William Carlos Williams claimed that de Angulo was one of the most outstanding writers I have ever encountered.&#x201d;<br><i>The Lariat</i>, which may well be his most important piece of fiction, is highlighted in this prize collection, along with other writings that have long been unavailable.</p><p>Jaime de Angulo was a cowboy, cattle rancher, horse-tamer, medical doctor, and linguist.

Since 9/11, more than four million illegal immigrants have crossed our borders, and there are more coming every day. Our leaders in Washington lack the political will to uphold the rule of law. The Melting Pot is broken beyond repair, and the future of our nation is at stake.<br>In this important book, Pat Buchanan reveals that, slowly but surely, the great American Southwest is being reconquered by Mexico. These lands---which many Mexicans believe are their birthright---are being detached ethnically, linguistically, and culturally from the United States by a deliberate policy of the Mexican regime. This is the "Aztlan Plot" for "La Reconquista," the recapture of the lands lost by Mexico in the Texas War of Independence and Mexican-American War. <br>Comparing the immigrant invasion of America from across the Mexican border---and of Europe from across the Mediterranean---to the barbarian invasions that ended the Roman Empire, the author writes with passion and conviction that we have begun the final chapter of the Death of the West. Unless the invasion is halted now, Buchanan argues, by midcentury America will be a country unrecognizable to our parents, the Third World dystopia that Theodore Roosevelt warned against when he said we must never let America become a "polyglot boardinghouse" for the world.&nbsp;<br>President Bush's failure to halt the invasion and secure America's border, Buchanan writes, is a dereliction of constitutional duty that, in other times, would have called forth articles of impeachment. In the final chapter, "Last Chance," he lays out a sweeping immigration reform and border security plan, which, he contends, if not pursued, means George W. Bush's legacy will be to have lost for America a Southwest that was the legacy of Sam Houston, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk. With an estimated ten to fifteen million "illegals" already here and tens of millions more poised to pour across our borders, few books could be as timely---or important---as <i>State of Emergency</i>. It is essential reading for all Americans.</p><p>"The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities," said Theodore Roosevelt. <i>State of Emergency </i>will demonstrate that this is exactly what is happening to America and may now be unstoppable.<br>The United States of 1960 was a First World nation, 90% of whose people traced their ancestry to Europe, 97% of whom spoke English. We studied the same history and literature in school, went to the same movies, read the same books, listened to the same radio and TV, cherished the same heroes. We were one nation and one people.<br>That America is dead and gone. The deconstruction of America -- along the lines of culture and values, language and faith, allegiance and loyalty -- has begun. By 2050, Americans of European descent will be a minority in the United States. One hundred million Hispanics with ties of language and loyalty to Mexico and Latin America will be living here, concentrated in the Southwest<br>It is the thesis of <i>State of Emergency</i> that the Melting Pot is broken beyond repair, that assimilation and Americanization are not taking place, and that only action is to seal and secure America&#x2019;s borders to halt the flow of over a million legal and illegal immigrants a year, and to begin the Americanization of the tens of millions of aliens in our midst can save America. Our civilization cannot survive indefinitely what is going on.<br>&nbsp;<i>State of Emergency&nbsp;</i>reveals who is doing this to us, why they are doing it, why this is our last chance, and how, if the will is there, we can yet save America from Balkanization and break-up.<p>"Eminently worth reading and pondering." <br>&#x2015;<i>The Washington Times</i></p><p>"[Buchanan] is a muscular writer, fully in command of the English language he feels is under siege. He is adept at linking history, statistics and the writings of philosophers and economists to proffer forceful arguments.

He is also right." <br>&#x2015;Tony Blankley, <i>The Washington Times</i></p><br><p><b>In this passionate best-seller, Patrick Buchanan documents the mortal peril America faces from massive, uncontrolled immigration from the third world.</b></p><p>Pat Buchanan is sounding the alarm. Since 9/11, more than four million illegal immigrants have crossed our borders&#x2015;and more come in every day. Politicians in Washington either lack the political will or can't agree on how to uphold the rule of law. The "melting pot" is cracked beyond repair, and the future of our nation is at stake.</p><p><i>State of Emergency</i> reveals the frightening truth about the effects of uncontrolled immigration and warns of the end of our culture as we know it. With his trademark passion and eloquence, Buchanan details the roots of the crisis and lays out a practical plan for immigration reform and border security. With an estimated ten to fifteen million "illegals" already here and untold millions more poised to cross our borders, and with Congress seemingly paralyzed, few books could be as timely&#x2015;or as important&#x2015;as <i>State of Emergency</i>.

Demonic, prodigiously long-bodied felines tower, sprawl and snooze in this first comprehensive collection of the artist's color cat prints and posters. In one poster-size ad for a brand of hot chocolate, a dewy young girl--modeled on Steinlen's daughter--gingerly defends her cup from a greedy cat. In another, for the Montmartre cafe Chat Noir (Black Cat), an eponymous fiend with prominent whiskers glares down at the viewer. Steinlen also sympathetically observes his subjects aslumber: the etching "Cat Lying Left to Right" brilliantly delineates an oblivious, furry bundle. Although some renderings are disappointingly two-dimensional, and not all attempts to capture cat character succeed, the artist never forgets that cats are predators: his sinuous images will inspire respectful shivers.

What is mind?"&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, starred review</strong></p> Johnjoe McFadden "enters new and provocative territory in his marriage of physics and biology" (<em>Science News</em>). His simple but staggering theory of quantum evolution shows how quantum mechanics gives living organisms the ability to initiate specific actions, including new mutations. As Paul Davies exclaims, "if these ideas are right, they will transform our understanding of the relationship between physics and biology" and may radically revise the notion of random evolution and the debate over consciousness and free will.</p><p>The hairiest heresy of evolutionary biology, the one most likely to get scientists figuratively burned at the stake, is the notion that any force more selective than blind chance could drive mutation. Such "directed evolution" smacks too much of a retreat into creationism for most science-minded readers to be comfortable with, but there's no a priori reason to reject the idea. Molecular biologist Johnjoe McFadden risks the Inquisition by suggesting just such a possibility in <i>Quantum Evolution: The New Science of Life</i>. Directed at a general but somewhat sophisticated readership, the book covers the basics of both standard evolutionary theory and quantum-level physics, then synthesizes them in an interesting theory of made-to-order mutation that explains enough to warrant attention and is, importantly, testable.<p> McFadden's writing is clear and sharp, and it shows a high regard for the reader's intelligence and patience for complex ideas. This is no airplane book--except for those already well-versed in the latest in both evolutionary theory and subatomic physics. The rewards of reading are great, and the author bows just enough to established theory that he might meet the fate of his intellectual predecessors. The ideas underlying <i>Quantum Evolution</i> may be right or wrong, but they challenge received wisdom without plunging into dogmatism--and that's good science. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Johnjoe McFadden is a Reader in Molecular Microbiology at the University of Surrey, England.</p><h2>10 Things I Hate About You</h2><p>Told she can&#39;t date until her older sister starts, Bianca fears no one will want to take out sarcastic Kat</p><p></p><h2>Reflections on a Marine Venus: A Companion to the Landscape of Rhodes</h2><p>This richly sensuous account of Durrell&#39;s years in the British civil service takes place after the end of World War II and just before the island of Rhodes is handed back to Greece. His evocative descriptions range from the scent of citrus groves and flowers of every form and color to the rhythm of the sea (alternately savage and soothing) and the play of light over the island as the sun moves across the sky. He intermingles these pleasant accounts with the grim reality of having to rebuild a nation and an island after Nazi cruelty has left it a shambles. &#34;Penetrating description, intense imagery, high and persistent color...it is a presentation which sparkles with an intense brilliance and fire.&#34; -- Christian Science Monitor</p><p>Born in Jalandhar, British India, in 1912 to Indian-born British colonials, Lawrence Durrell was a critically hailed and beloved novelist, poet, humorist, and travel writer best known for the Alexandria Quartet novels, which were ranked by the Modern Library as among the greatest works of English literature in the twentieth century. A passionate and dedicated writer from an early age, Durrell s prolific career also included the groundbreaking Avignon Quintet, whose first novel, &#34;Monsieur &#34;(1974), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and whose third novel, &#34;Constance &#34;(1982), was nominated for the Booker Prize.

Lamy&#39;s accomplishments, including the endowing of hospitals, orphanages, and English-language schools and colleges, formed the foundation of modern-day Santa Fe and often brought him into conflict with corrupt local priests. His life story, also the subject of Willa Cather&#39;s Death Comes for the Archbishop, describes a pivotal period in the American Southwest, as Spanish and Mexican rule gave way to much greater influence from the U.S. and Europe.

Legend dates the text to antediluvian times, saved from the flood by Noah himself, while serious scholarship places its origin in the second century b.c.e., as old as ancient Sumeria and Babylon. Providing insight into the foundation of Christianity and the pre-Christian Gnostics, the text is perhaps most remarkable for its significant deviation from the apocryphal story that appears in the Bible. The final Christian version of the apocalypse leaves the damned on a hellish earth, while welcoming the chosen to heaven. <i>The Book of Enoch the Prophet</i> draws a very different picture--upon the return of the Messiah, evil will be banished from the face of the earth, resulting in a heaven on earth.</p><br><br><p>A new introduction to this edition by esoteric scholar R.A. Gilbert places the book in context, including an overview of the modern history of The Book of Enoch. It's an Indiana Jones-like story: lost for thousands of years after being banned by the early Christians, the ancient manuscript was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century. This sparked research for other fragments, which were subsequently found and together revealed the complete ancient text, first translated into English and published in 1821.</p></p><p>R.H.

The Maestros live in Old Lyme, CT.</p>Grade 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;This book demonstrates the importance of many significant events of an often neglected era, such as the formation of the three branches of U.S. government; ongoing conflicts with France and Britain, including the War of 1812; the Louisiana Purchase; and the Lewis and Clark expedition. Giulio Maestro's pastel and watercolor illustrations are atmospheric and somewhat idealized. Every scene, from crowded city streets to busy ports, looks clean and pleasant. Soldiers killed in battle are scattered across fields in a way that makes them resemble toy soldiers more than wounded men. However, the pictures do provide a sense of period architecture and dress. The text is continuous, more like a story than a collection of dry facts, and will work as a read-aloud. On the negative side, the narrative focus spotlights the "Founding Fathers" rather than taking the more expansive view many modern history books adopt. The only women mentioned are Sacajawea, Abigail Adams, and Dolley Madison; the only references to African Americans are in the context of slavery, with no individuals mentioned by name. However, Native Americans do receive attention and Tecumseh is one of a group of leaders whose writings are included in a section of quotes. No bibliography or sources for further reading are listed. Because the book is not divided into sections or chapters, children may have difficulty extracting information for reports. While not a first choice for research, this book is successful in bringing history to life.&#x2014;<i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i> END</p><h2>The Medici Women</h2><p>The Medici Women.

Unlike cats, which have only nine lives, bluebears have twenty-seven. This is fortunate, because our hero is forever avoiding disaster by a paw's breadth. In this remarkable book, Captain Bluebear tells the story of his first thirteen-and-a-half lives spent on the mysterious continent of Zamonia, where intelligence is an infectious disease and water flows uphill, where headless giants roam deserts made of sugar, and where only Captain Bluebear's courage and ingenuity enable him to escape the dangers that lie in wait for him around every corner.

Duck provides theological foundations for worship and explores the variety of ways Christians have adapted worship to various cultures to help them live faithfully and to communicate the Gospel to others. The author celebrates the many languages and cultural settings in which the Gospel has been, and is, preached, sung, and prayed. The goal of this volume is to support good pastoral and congregational reflection on what worship is and does. Consequently, Duck discusses many different forms of worship from several cultures (African-American, Asian, Euro-American) and offers advice on how to read a congregation and define its culture in order to plan culturally appropriate worship. Although the book does not offer prescriptive formulas or advise a single pattern of worship, it includes many practical suggestions for preparing and leading worship, including diverse ministries of music, movement, and visual arts that are becoming more popular today.</p><p>From worship's theological underpinnings the book turns to worship leadership, forms of prayer, preaching, the sacraments, ordination, and various other liturgies. Because of its emphasis on vital and Spirit-led worship, this comprehensive book on Christian worship will be used in years to come not only as a core textbook for seminarians and ministry students from a variety of cultures and traditions, but also as a resource for local church pastors and laity who are dedicated to the enlivening of Christian worship.</p></p><p><p><b>Ruth C.

In <i>Letters to a Young Therapist</i>, Dr. Pipher shares what she has learned in thirty years as a therapist, helping warring families, alienated adolescents, and harried professionals restore peace and beauty to their lives. <i>Letters to a Young Therapist</i> gives voice to her practice with an exhilarating mix of storytelling and sharp-eyed observation. And while her letters are addressed to an imagined young therapist, every one of us can take something away from them. Long before "positive psychology" became a buzzword, Dr. Pipher practiced a refreshingly inventive therapy--fiercely optimistic, free of dogma or psychobabble, and laced with generous warmth and practical common sense. But not until now has this gifted healer described her unique perspective on how therapy can help us revitalize our emotional landscape in an increasingly stressful world. Whether she's recommending daily swims for a sluggish teenager, encouraging a timid husband to become bolder, or simply bearing witness to a bereaved parent's sorrow, Dr. Pipher's compassion and insight shine from every page of this thoughtful and engaging book.</p><p><b>Mary Pipher</b> has explored the influence of culture on mental health in five books, including the best sellers <i>The Shelter of Each Other, Another Country</i>, and the landmark <i>Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls</i>, which spent 154 weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list and has been translated into nineteen languages. Her most recent book, <i>The Middle of Everywhere: The World's Refugees Come to Our Town</i> (Harcourt, 2002), explores the effects of globalization on American society. Dr. Pipher has traveled all over the world lecturing to students, health care professionals and community groups. She lives in Lincoln, Nebraska."Most people find talking to God more satisfying than talking to Freud," says Pipher, whether they believe in God or not. For fans of the bestselling Reviving Ophelia, such perfectly pitched, patient-centered observations will seem familiar and most welcome; for first-timers, Pipher invites readers: "Make some peach tea and find a cat for your lap. Let's visit." Even the most cynical psych snob will find that visit-a series of seasonally themed letters to a fictional graduate student describing psychotherapy from the inside out-refreshing, informative and insightful. In the brief time it takes to read this slim volume, the rhythms of blather and breakthrough, resistance and revelation come through clearly. Pipher also talks readers into becoming their own therapists, and good ones at that; her epistolary persona is one of a sympathetic woman but not a fuzzy emotional thinker. She admits "All families are a little crazy, but that's because all humans are a little crazy" and "Some therapy is just plain plodding," but she also includes many anecdotes that illuminate how a well-crafted metaphor, moment of quiet or carefully timed suggestion can change a life forever. Her view of therapists as storytellers is borne out in direct, engaging prose and succinct observation. To take just one example, Pipher notes that women see apologizing as saying, "I am sorry I hurt your feelings or caused you pain." Men see it as "I am eating shit." That's Mars and Venus in two sentences, and there's plenty more. The well-known perils of the profession emerge freshly, but also its profound rewards.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Be Gay</h2><p>No one raises an eyebrow if you suggest that a guy who arranges his furniture just so, rolls his eyes in exaggerated disbelief, likes techno music or show tunes, and knows all of Bette Davis&#x2019;s best lines by heart might, just possibly, be gay. But if you assert that male homosexuality is a cultural practice, expressive of a unique subjectivity and a distinctive relation to mainstream society, people will immediately protest. Such an idea, they will say, is just a stereotype ridiculously simplistic, politically irresponsible, and morally suspect. The world acknowledges gay male culture as a fact but denies it as a truth.David Halperin, a pioneer of LGBTQ studies, dares to suggest that gayness is a specific way of being that gay men must learn from one another in order to become who they are. Inspired by the notorious undergraduate course of the same title that Halperin taught at the University of Michigan, provoking cries of outrage from both the right-wing media and</p><p>David M. Halperin is W. H.

Macho, faggy, queeny, butch diva, opera-swilling, Broadway-loving, gourmet, sex-fascinated, beauty-appreciating, love-desiring, rough trade, high art, race- and class-inflected but not exclusive, generationally situated but not entirely, intellectual, open-hearted, politically minded, leather chaps! Mary! (Sarah Schulman, author of Ties That Bind: Familial Homophobia and Its Consequences)<br><br><i>How To Be Gay</i> is a sheer pleasure to read and utterly thoughtful too: it is pedagogical in the most provocative sense. David Halperin's acute attention to gay male sensibility provides a great case study in how sexuality takes shape as such, finding anchors for the expression of its pleasures and its dramas. A genuinely profound contribution to the scholarship on kitsch, camp, and melodrama, this book is also its own command performance of a gayness it wants to extend to its readers as a kind of friendly and exciting disturbance. (Lauren Berlant, University of Chicago)<br><br>I've always been a big fan of Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, and Doris Day. Though it was a secret, shameful love. David Halperin's wonderful, wildly ambitious masterpiece has given me the courage to come out about it. And even tell the golden daffodils. As Halperin eloquently explains, desire into identity will not go, even with plenty of poppers and lube. What's more, the dignified, proper, and very particular gay identity really doesn't <i>deserve</i> the giddy, gushing, world-grabbing gay sensibility. And vice versa. (Mark Simpson, journalist)<br><br><i>How To Be Gay</i>, with its teasing title, asks whether there might be such a thing as gay culture that resides neither in our genes nor in our psyches. By insisting on gayness as a social form, the book offers an important provocation to contemporary queer criticism that resists the specification of identity. One could ask for no better guide through the complexities of late twentieth-century American gay male culture. (Heather Love, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>[How To Be Gay is] an attempt to unpack [Halperin's] basic observation that there's far more to gay male American identity than a same-sex preference. Halperin interprets gayness through traditional pop culture preoccupations like golden age Hollywood, opera, and Broadway musicals, focusing on Joan Crawford (in particular her role in Mildred Pierce) and Faye Dunaway's notoriously over-the-top portrayal of the star in Mommie Dearest. Identifying the source of the camp appeal exerted by these ostensibly serious films, Halperin asks why gay men continue to be drawn to coded representations of their experience. He arrives at an apologia for such clich�d signposts of gayness in an era of domestic partnerships and 'Born This Way.' Halperin persuasively defuses charges of misogyny lobbed against gay male culture. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2012-06-08)<br><br>[Halperin] provocatively argues that when it comes to defining what it means to be a homosexual man, sex is overrated... Culture matters more... [How To Be Gay] is never a bore... [It] explores a fundamental kind of gay sensibility... Halperin teases an enormous amount out of [a] scene [in Mildred Pierce], including the sense of 'glamour and abjection' gay audiences find in [Joan] Crawford, and how the film packages the 'transgressive spectacle of female strength, autonomy, feistiness and power.' ...Halperin works up to an argument (impossible to summarize here) about how the film evokes a 'dissident perspective' on the very idea of romantic love. He is articulate about many other things in this book, including how gay men often find more resonance in straight cultural artifacts than in gay ones. His funny shorthand for this is: 'Why would we want Edmund White, when we still have The Golden Girls?" ...He is excellent, too, on how classical tragedy is nearly always about men, or fathers and sons... Dozens of similar arguments are rehearsed in How To Be Gay. Halperin even neatly mows down hipster irony in the face of the kind of gay male irony that defines camp. It's a kaleidoscopic book that at its base breaks with what the author calls 'the Brokeback Mountain crowd.' He urges gay men to take their so-called femininity out of 'homosexuality's newly built closet,' to see it plainly and to give it affirmative interpretations. (Dwight Garner <i>New York Times</i> 2012-08-07)<br><br>Halperin parses the pop culture of movies, music, style, camp, drag, and those totemic figures known as gay icons, to reveal the dirty little secret that many gay people may not wish to hear: there's a hard little kernel of truth behind the stereotypes. (Richard J. Violette <i>Library Journal</i> 2012-08-01)<br><br>How To Be Gay makes for as fun a viewing companion [to Mildred Pierce and Mommie Dearest] as it does a rigorously intelligent read... Whether you're well-versed in all things gay or tend to avoid pop divas at all costs, How To Be Gay offers a fresh perspective on what we call gay culture, why so many of us love what we love and why we're afraid to talk about it. Thankfully, as Halperin notes in his conclusion, gay male culture isn't going anywhere&#x2014;as long as there's a straight culture to appropriate for our own ends. (Jameson Fitzpatrick <i>Next Magazine</i> 2012-08-10)<br><br>What is marvelous is Halperin's rich analysis of many aspects of this gay cultural life, showing the distinctive ways it makes use of straight culture... This is not meant to be a coffee-table book, encyclopedia or 'how-to manual': these already exist. It is rather an erudite meditation by one of the world's leading queer theorists. It provokes, sparkles and bristles with ideas, claims, defenses and the kind of epigrams...that would make for great seminar discussions... This is a great book, it will generate heated debate. (Ken Plummer <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2012-08-23)<br><br>David M. Halperin has written a monumental work... In detail, the book explores the emotional and personalized subjectivity in describing what is at the core of gay culture and the innermost feelings of what it is to be 'gay.' ...It is Halperin's intent to create a serious dialogue, though there are many smiles to be had at the same time, while absorbing the process. How To Be Gay is both enlightening and refreshing in the personal discovery of self or for lack of a better phrase, the perfect way to understand the how, what, where and why 'to turn your inner-gay on.'

As Tremayne, he is best known for his stories and novels featuring 7th century Irish religieuse, Fidelma of Cashel. He lives in London.&nbsp; CHAPTER ONE<br>Ferloga had been an innk�eper most of his adult life and was in the habit of boasting that he had seen all manner of guests &#x2013; rich and poor, the arrogant and the humble. He had had dealings with kings and chieftains, religious of all descriptions, rich merchants, travelling players, farmers passing on their way to market and even beggars desperate for shelter. Ferloga&#x2019;s proud claim was that no guest had ever tried to cheat him of his fee, for there were few of them that he was unable to judge; after a glance, he could tell what calling in life they followed and whether they were trustworthy or not. But, as the elderly innkeeper sat talking with his wife while she finished cleaning the utensils after the morning meal, he freely confessed to confusion. The guest who had arrived not long after nightfall on the previous evening had been an utter mystery to him.A tall, thin man, almost skeletal, the pale parchment-like skin had stretched tightly over his bony features. That he was elderly was indisputable, but whether sixty or eighty years of age was impossible to discern. He had curious eyes, the left one made sinister by the white film of a cataract. His unkempt white hair seemed to tumble in all directions, thick and curly, ending around his shoulders. His neck reminded Ferloga of a chicken&#x2019;s scrawny folds with a prominent bobbing Adam&#x2019;s apple. A dark grey woollen cloak, which had probably once been white, covered the man from neck to ankles. He carried a long wooden staff with curious carving on it, and a leather satchel was slung from his shoulder.At first Ferloga had thought that he was a wandering religious, for he certainly looked like one of the hermits that one infrequently encountered on the road, and it was clear that he had arrived on foot. However, once he loosened his cloak, the stranger displayed none of the usual symbols of the New Faith but wore a curious necklet of gold and semi-precious stones which, Ferloga knew, no religious would ever wear.The conversation had been unexpectedly short. Ferloga was used to some sociability from his guests but this elderly traveller merely demanded a bed. He even declined a traditional mug of <i>corma</i> to protect against the chill of the night. When Ferloga asked whither he had come, the man replied: &#x2018;A long journey from the north,&#x2019; and nothing more. Ferloga took the view that the man was exhausted from his travels and, indeed, he noticed that the newcomer was swaying slightly and the dark skin under his eyes was a trifle puffy. So the innkeeper did not press the late arrival further but conducted him to a small room above the stairs, and withdrew.Now, in the light of dawn, Ferloga was still wondering about his mysterious guest.His plump wife sniffed in irritation as she gave the cauldron of porridge, still warming over the fire, a stir to stop it sticking.&#x2018;Rather than sit there trying to make guesses, why don&#x2019;t you go and rouse the man. It&#x2019;s long past sun up. All the other guests have risen, broken their fasts and continued on their way. I do not plan to stay here all day making sure the porridge does not burn. I need to go berry picking.&#x2019;Ferloga sighed and slowly rose from his comfortable seat by the side of the fire. Lassar, was right, of course. The business of the inn could not wait for ever and it was unusual for guests to delay so long in the morning.<br><br>Fidelma of Cashel halted her horse on a rise of the road, which ran from Cluain Meala, the Field of Honey, the settlement on the banks of the broad River Si�r, where she had spent the night, north to her brother&#x2019;s fortress. She had spent a week away from Cashel in attendance at Lios Mh�r, the great abbey and settlement south beyond the mountain range of Mhaoldomhnaigh. Although she had slept well the previous night, Fidelma felt exhausted after a week&#x2019;s hard work. She was a <i>d�laigh,</i> or advocate, of the law courts of the five kingdoms of �ireann, proficient to the degree of <i>anruth</i>, the second highest qualification in the land. Her rank therefore allowed her not only to plead cases before judges but, when nominated, to hear and adjudicate in her own court on a range of applications that did not require the presence of a judge of higher rank. It was a task that Brehon Baithen, the senior judge of the kingdom of Muman, often requested her to perform. It was also a task that she liked least.She frequently found it tiring to sit in a stifling court and listen to the complaints and arguments of those who appeared before her. Often it was a waste of time and the plaintiffs should have been advised that their claims, more often than not, were born from pettiness and malice and without foundation in law. But it was her task and duty to sit patiently and decide whether there was a case to be answered and whether it should be brought before a more senior Brehon. And, after a week in the law courts at Lios Mh�r, she felt drained and irritable and was delighted when she could finally mount her horse and set off across the mountains back towards her brother&#x2019;s royal fortress at Cashel.Turning in her saddle, she watched her companion trotting up towards her. The youthful warrior who joined her was Caol, the commander of her brother&#x2019;s guard. He had been designated to act as her escort on the trip.Fidelma smiled as he reined in his mount beside her and gestured with an outstretched arm. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s R�th na Dr�nne ahead. I could do with refreshment at Ferloga&#x2019;s inn before we continue on to Cashel.&#x2019;Caol inclined his head briefly. &#x2018;As it pleases you, lady.&#x2019; Those who knew Fidelma as sister to Colg�, King of Muman, always used the respectful form of address rather than her ecclesiastical one of Sister. Caol added: &#x2018;We did leave Cluain Meala without breaking our fast and I could do with something to fill the emptiness in my stomach.&#x2019;There was a slight note of rebuke in his voice as he reminded Fidelma of her eagerness to be off even before daylight that morning. However, Caol knew why Fidelma was anxious to return to Cashel. She had been a week away from her little son, Alch�, and Caol appreciated her anxiety as a mother. He knew that she must be feeling an additional anxiety because her husband Eadulf, the Saxon, had left Cashel over a week before on an embassy to the abbey at Ros Ailithir on behalf of S�gdae, Abbot of Imleach and chief bishop of Muman. How long he would be away on his embassy, which involved matters of ecclesiastical importance, was anyone&#x2019;s guess. Perhaps he would be gone several weeks. That being so, Caol had tried not to complain about her general impatience and quickness of temper during this last week.Fidelma was smiling almost apologetically at him, as if she read his thoughts.&#x2018;I know, I know,&#x2019; she said softly. &#x2018;Had I not been in such a hurry to be on the road to Cashel this morning, we could have broken our fasts and had something warming to keep out the chill on the journey. But Ferloga&#x2019;s inn lies ahead of us and we can soon rectify the lack of nourishment caused by my impatience.&#x2019;She turned and nudged her horse forward towards the distant rise of R�th na Dr�nne.It was not long before they trotted into the yard before the inn, causing the chickens and geese to start an angry chorus at being disturbed. Before they began to dismount, the door of the inn swung open and Ferloga himself came hurrying out. The first thing that Fidelma noticed was his pale features and concerned expression.&#x2018;What ails you, Ferloga?&#x2019; she asked, frowning down at him.&#x2018;Lady ...&#x2019; The innkeeper&#x2019;s expression seemed to brighten as he recognised her. &#x2018;Thank God that you have come.&#x2019;Fidelma raised an eyebrow in query as she dismounted and faced the elderly innkeeper.&#x2018;You appear distraught, Ferloga. What is the trouble?&#x2019;&#x2018;One of my guests, lady,&#x2019; replied the man. &#x2018;He was late to rise and so I went up to wake him. I have just found him in bed &#x2013; dead.&#x2019;Caol had dismounted and was taking Fidelma&#x2019;s reins from her. &#x2018;Dead?&#x2019; He suddenly looked interested. &#x2018;Murdered?&#x2019;Ferloga looked shocked. &#x2018;Murdered? I hadn&#x2019;t thought ...&#x2019;&#x2018;Put the horses in the stable, Caol,&#x2019; Fidelma instructed before turning to the shocked innkeeper. &#x2018;Come, let us examine this body. Who is this guest, anyway?&#x2019;As he turned to lead the way back into the inn, Ferloga contrived to shrug. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve no idea, lady. He arrived late last night and told me nothing. He was elderly, that is all I know.&#x2019;As they entered the inn, Lassar came forward anxiously. &#x2018;Ah, it is good that you are here, lady. This could be bad for us if the kin of the guest claim we have been neglectful in our duties towards him and somehow contributed to his death.&#x2019;Fidelma knew exactly why the elderly couple were concerned. The laws for innkeepers in the <i>Bretha Nemed Toisech</i> were very precise about their responsibilities. A guest, by virtue of the fact, was given legal protection, and anyone killed or injured while under that protection was counted to have been a victim of the crime of <i>d�guin,</i> the violation of such protection. The responsibility was down to the <i>fer tige o�get</i> or the guest-house owner, whether it was a public hostel or a private inn. If responsible, Ferloga might lose his inn and be fined a heavy sum.Fidelma gave the old woman a smile of reassurance. &#x2018;Where is the body?&#x2019; she asked Ferloga.He turned to ascend the dark wooden stairs that led to the upper floor. &#x2018;This way,&#x2019; he said.The body lay on its back in the bed. Ferloga had already opened the shutters to allow light to flood into the room. Fidelma wished that Eadulf was with her. Having studied medical matters for a period in Tuam Brecain, the renowned Irish medical college, his knowledge would have been invaluable. She bent down and allowed her eye to traverse the body of the old man who lay there. There were two things she noticed immediately. The facial muscles seemed twisted into a grimace, as if a last moment of pain had been frozen on the features. That death could not have taken place much before dawn was clear because the flesh was not really cold. The second thing she noticed was that the pale lips were blue, unusually so. Disguising her distaste, she drew back the covers and quickly ascertained that there were no marks of physical violence on the body. Replacing the covers, she stood up, turning to face the anxious Ferloga.At that moment, Caol came hurrying up the stairs into the room and cast a look at the corpse.&#x2018;Can I help, lady?&#x2019; he asked.Fidelma shook her head. &#x2018;Take a closer look and see if you agree with me. I believe the old man suffered a fit.&#x2019; She used the word <i>taem</i> to indicate the condition.Caol glanced down, nodding. &#x2018;Blue and twisted lips and a convulsion of the muscles. I have observed the like before, lady, on the battlefield. Twice now I have seen men work themselves up into such a rage that, suddenly, they clutch at their chests and their faces become contorted and they fall into a paroxysm. Many have died from it.&#x2019;Fidelma agreed. &#x2018;There seems no barrier to the condition, old age nor youth. I have even heard that some can survive the fit, and have described it as a terrible, debilitating pain here in the centre of the chest. No, have no fear, Ferloga, yours is not the responsibility for this death.&#x2019;There was a deep sigh of relief from the doorway. Lassar had followed Caol up the stairs and stood watching them.&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll go below and prepare some refreshment for you, lady,&#x2019; she said.&#x2018;If you have fresh bread and honey, it will more than satisfy me,&#x2019; Caol added quickly as the old woman turned away.Fidelma was gazing quizzically down at the corpse again. &#x2018;Who was he?&#x2019; she asked.Ferloga shrugged. &#x2018;I had little chance to find out. He arrived after dark, only said that he was from the north, which was not a matter of surprise for I could hear the northern accents in his speech. He answered no questions, asked only one of his own, ate nothing, drank less and demanded to be shown to his bed.&#x2019;Fidelma looked keenly at the innkeeper. &#x2018;Asked only one question? What was that?&#x2019;&#x2018;He asked what road he should take this morning to find Cn�nmchailli.&#x2019;Fidelma shook her head thoughtfully. &#x2018;The place beyond Ara&#x2019;s well? But there is nothing there, only an ancient pillar stone.&#x2019;&#x2018;Just what I said,&#x2019; agreed Ferloga. &#x2018;But he wanted to know the road, so I told him.&#x2019;&#x2018;Did you form any opinion of the man? You have a reputation for knowing your guests even when you spend only a few moments with them.&#x2019;Ferloga grimaced wryly. &#x2018;I was saying only this morning to Lassar that I am perplexed. At first, I thought he was a religious until I examined his clothing and ornaments more closely. Alas, this man puzzles me.&#x2019;&#x2018;And he came here on foot?&#x2019; asked Caol. When Fidelma shot him a glance of surprise, Caol added, by way of explanation: &#x2018;When I dealt with our horses just now, I saw no other horse in the stable that would belong to a guest.&#x2019;&#x2018;You are right,&#x2019; Ferloga said. &#x2018;This man arrived on foot with only that strange staff to help him on his travels.&#x2019;Fidelma moved to the ornately carved staff that had been propped in a corner of the room. Taking it in her hands she gazed curiously at the dark oak wood which was mounted and tipped with bronze, both as a spiked ferrule and as an ornate headed piece. In fact, at the top part of the staff, the piece of bronze was shaped as a head wearing a tore; a male head with a long, flowing moustache and some semi-precious glinting red stones for the eyes. From ear to ear was a crescent-shaped head-dress studded with little triskel-style solar symbols.&#x2018;It&#x2019;s quite beautiful,&#x2019; muttered Caol, gazing over her shoulder.&#x2018;It&#x2019;s also quite old,&#x2019; said Ferloga.&#x2018;It&#x2019;s certainly very ancient,&#x2019; agreed Fidelma. &#x2018;I seem to have seen those symbols before, but I can&#x2019;t quite recall where ...&#x2019;&#x2018;There are curious symbols and animals carved all over the staff,&#x2019; observed Caol, pointing. &#x2018;It must be very valuable.&#x2019;&#x2018;What else did he carry that might identify him?&#x2019; demanded Fidelma, turning to Ferloga.The innkeeper gestured at a leather satchel, which the man had been carrying the night before. There was also the richly inscribed gorget, which he had worn around his neck and which was now placed on the table by the side of the bed. The old man had obviously removed it from his neck before reposing himself for sleep.&#x2018;Apart from his robe and clothing, there is only the satchel and this ornament.&#x2019;The satchel revealed no more than a change of clothing, an extra pair of sandals and a knife, and such toilet items as anyone might carry. However, if the staff had been a fascinating object of art then the gorget was even more so. The necklet was made of intricately beaten gold, decorated with all manner of ancient symbols that also seemed disturbingly familiar to Fidelma &#x2013; but which she could not place at all. She was about to remark on it when Caol gave a grunt of surprise.She turned to see him removing a small leather bag from under the pillow on which the old man&#x2019;s head lay. He held it up and the bag clinked as if it contained metal. He handed it to Fidelma.&#x2018;I think we&#x2019;ll find that this strange old man was rich,&#x2019; he said.Fidelma opened the string that tied the leather pouch together. Indeed, it was full of coins, mainly of gold and silver but with a few bronze coins. She glanced at several o...</p><h2>Healing Anger: The Power of Patience from a Buddhist Perspective</h2><p>All the world's major religions emphasize the importance of the practice of love, compassion, and tolerance.

A spring dawn on Flamborough Head, where the rock of the Yorkshire Wolds juts out into the North Sea like a gigantic fishhook, millions of tons in weight. Pointing out to sea, pointing to the ever-present threat of the Vikings. Now the kings of the little kingdoms were uneasily beginning to draw together against this threat from the North. Uneasy and jealous, remembering the long hostilities and the trail of murder that had marked the history of the Angles and the Saxons ever since they came here centuries ago. Proud warsmiths who overcame the Welsh, noble warriors who--as the poets say--obtained the land.Godwin the Thane cursed to himself as he paced the wooden palisade of the little fort erected on the very tip of Flamborough Head itself. Spring! Maybe in more fortunate parts the lengthening days and the light evenings meant greenery and buttercups and heavy-uddered cows trooping to the byres to be milked. Here on the Head it meant wind. It meant the equinoctial gales and the nor'easter blowing. Behind him the low, gnarled trees stood in line, one behind the other like men with their backs turned, each successive one a few inches higher than the one to windward, so that they formed natural wind-arrows or weathercocks, pointing out to the tormented sea. On three sides all round him the gray water heaved slowly like an immense animal, thewaves starting to curl and then flattening out again as the wind tore at them, beating them down and levelling out even the massive surges of the ocean. Gray sea, gray sky, squalls blotting the horizon, no color in the world at all except when the rollers finally crashed into the striated walls of the cliffs, shattering and sending up great plumes of spray. Godwin had been there so long that he no longer heard the roar of the collision, noticed it only when the spray reached so high up the cliff that the water which soaked his cloak and hood and dripped onto his face turned salt instead of fresh.Not that it made any difference, he thought numbly. It was all just as cold. He could go back into the shelter, kick the slaves aside, warm his frozen hands and feet by the fire. There was no chance of raiders on a day like this. The Vikings were seamen, the greatest seamen in the world, or so they said. You didn't have to be a great seaman to know that there was no point in putting out on a day like this. The wind was due east--no, he reflected, due east a point north. Fine for blowing you across from Denmark, but how could you keep a longship from broaching to in this sea? And how could you steer for a safe landing once you arrived? No, no chance at all. He might as well be by the fire.Godwin looked longingly at the shelter with its little trail of smoke instantly whipped away by the wind, but turned his pace and began to shuffle along the palisade again. His lord had trained him well. "Don't think, Godwin," he had said. "Don't think maybe they'll come today and maybe they won't. Don't believe that it's worth keeping a lookout some of the time and it's not worth it the rest. While it's day, you stay on the Head. Look out all the time. Or one day you'll be thinking one thing and some Stein or Olaf'll think another and they'll be ashore and twenty miles inland before we can catch up with them--if we ever do. And that's a hundred lives lost and a hundred pounds in silver and cattle and burnt thatch. And the rents not paid for years after. So watch, Thane, or it's your estates that will suffer."So his lord Ella had said. And behind him the black crow,Erkenbert, had crouched over his parchment, his quill squeaking as he traced out the mysterious black lines that Godwin feared more than he feared the Vikings. "Two months' service on Flamborough Head to Godwin the thane," he had pronounced. "He is to watch till the third Sunday after <i>Ramis Palmarum.</i>" The alien syllables had nailed the orders down.Watch they had said and watch he would. But he didn't have to do it as dry as a reluctant virgin. Godwin bellowed downwind to the slaves, for the hot spiced ale he had commanded half an hour before. Instantly one of them came running out, the leather mug in his hand. Godwin eyed him with deep disfavor as he trotted over to the palisade and up the ladder to the watchkeeper's walkway. A damned fool, this one. Godwin kept him because he had sharp eyes, but that was all. Merla, his name. He had been a fisherman once. Then there had been a hard winter, little to catch, he had fallen behind with the dues he owed to his landlords, the black monks of St. John's Minister at Beverley, twenty miles off. First he had sold his boat to pay his dues and feed his wife and bairns. Then, when he had no money and could not feed them any longer, he had had to sell his family to a richer man, and in the end had sold himself to his former landlords. And they had lent Merla to Godwin. Damned fool. If the slave had been a man of honor he would have sold himself first and given the money to his wife's kin, so at least they would have taken her in. If he had been a man of sense he would have sold his wife and the bairns first and kept the boat. Then maybe he would have had a chance to buy them back. But he was a man of neither sense nor honor. Godwin turned his back on the wind and the sea and took a firm swallow from the brimming mug. At least the slave hadn't been sipping from it. He could learn from a thrashing if from nothing else.Now what was the wittol staring at? Staring past his master's shoulder, mouth agape, pointing out to sea."Ships," he yelled. "Viking ships, two mile out to sea. I see 'em again. Look, master, look!"Godwin spun automatically, cursed as the hot liquid slopped over his sleeve, peered out into the cloud and rain along the pointing arm. Was there a dot there, out where the cloud met the waves? No, nothing. Or ... maybe. He could see nothing steadily, but out there the waves would be running twenty feet high, high enough to shelter any ship trying to ride out a storm under bare poles."I see 'em," yelled Merla again. "Two ships, a cable apart.""Longships?""No, master, knorrs."Godwin hurled the mug over his shoulder, seized the slave's thin arm in an iron grasp, and slashed him viciously across the face, forehand, backhand, with a sodden leather gauntlet. Merla gasped and ducked but did not dare to try to shield himself."Talk English, you whore's get. And talk sense.""A knorr, master. It's a merchant ship. Deep-bellied, for cargo." He hesitated, afraid to show further knowledge, afraid to conceal it. "I can recognize 'un by ... by the shape of the prow. They must be Vikings, master. We don't use 'em."Godwin stared out to sea again, anger fading, replaced by a cold, hard feeling at the base of his stomach. Doubt. Dread."Listen, Merla, to me," he whispered. "Be very sure. If those are Vikings must call out the entire coast-watch, every man from here to Bridlington. They are only churls and slaves, when all is said and done. No harm if they are dragged from their greasy wives."But I must do something else. As soon as the watch is called I must also send riders in to the minister at Beverley, to the monks of good St. John--your masters, remember?"He paused to note the terror and the old memories in Merla's eyes."And they will call out the mounted levy, the thanes of Ella. No good keeping them here, where the pirates could feint at Flamborough and then be twenty miles off roundSpurn Head before they could get their horses out of the marsh. So they stay back, so they can ride in any direction once the threat is seen. But if I call them out, and they ride over here in the wind and the rain on a fool's errand ... And especially if some Viking sneaks in through the Humber while their backs are turned ..."Well, it would be bad for me, Merla." His voice sharpened and he lifted the underfed slave off the ground. "But by almighty God in heaven I'll see you regret it till the last day you live. And after the thrashing you get that may not be long."But, Merla, if those are Viking ships out there and you let me <i>not</i> report them--I'll hand you back to the black monks and say I could do nothing with you."Now, what do you say? Viking ships, or no?"The slave stared out again to sea, his face working. He would have been wiser, he thought, to say nothing. What was it to him if the Vikings sacked Flamborough, or Bridlington, or Beverley Minster itself? They could not enslave him any more than he was already. Maybe foreign heathens would be better masters than the people of Christ at home. Too late to think that now. The sky was clearing, momentarily. He could see, even if his weak-eyed landlubber of a master could not. He nodded."Two Viking ships, master. Two mile out to sea. Southeast."Godwin was away, bellowing instructions, calling to his other slaves, shouting for his horse, his horn, his small, reluctant force of conscripted freemen. Merla straightened, walked slowly to the southwest angle of the palisade, looked out thoughtfully and carefully. The weather cleared momentarily, and for a few heartbeats he could see plain. He looked at the run of the waves--the turbid yellow line a hundred yards offshore which marked the long, long expanse of tidal sandbanks which ran the full length of this barest and most harborless, wind- and current-swept stretch of English shore--tossed a handful of moss from the palisadeinto the air and studied the way it flew. Slowly a grim and humorless smile creased his careworn face.Great sailors those Vikings might be. But they were in the wrong place, on a lee shore with a widow-maker blowing. Unless the wind dropped, or their heathen gods from Valhalla could help them, they stood no chance. They would never see Jutland or the Vik again.&nbsp;<br>Two hours later fivescore men stood clustered on the beach south of the Head, at the north end of the long, long, inletless stretch of coast that ran down to Spurn Head and the mouth of the Humber. They were armed: leather jackets and caps, spears, wooden shields, a scattering of the broadaxes they used to shape their boats and houses. Here and there a sax, the short chopping sword from which the Saxons to the south took their name. Only Godwin had a metal helmet and mail-shirt to pull on, a brass-hilted broadsword to buckle round his waist. In the normal way of things men like these, the coast-watch of Bridlington, would not hope or expect to stand on the shore and trade blows with the professional warriors of Denmark and Norway. Rather, they would fade away, taking as much as they could of their goods and wives with them. Waiting for the mounted levy, the thane-service of Northumbria, to come down and do the fighting for which they earned their estates and manor houses. Waiting hopefully for a chance to swarm forward and join in the harassing of a beaten enemy, the chance of taking loot. It was not a chance which had come to any Englishman since Oakley fourteen years before. And that had been in the south, in the foreign kingdom of Wessex, where all manner of strange things happened.Nevertheless the mood of the men watching the knorrs out in the bay was unalarmed, even cheerful. Almost every man in the coast-watch was a fisherman, skilled in the ways of the North Sea. The worst water in the world, with its fogs and gales, its monstrous tides and unexpected currents. As the day strengthened and the Viking ships were blown remorselessly closer in, Merla's realization had come to everyone :The Vikings were doomed. It was just a matter of what they could try next. And whether they would try it, lose, and get the wreck over with before the mounted levy Godwin had summoned hours before could arrive, resplendent in its armor, colored cloaks and gold-mounted swords. After which, opinion among the fishermen felt, the chances of any worthwhile plunder for them were low. Unless they marked the spot and tried later, in secret, with grappling irons ... Quiet conversations ran among the men at the rear, with an occasional low laugh."See," the town reeve was explaining to Godwin at the front, "the wind's east a point north. If they put up a scrap of sail they can run west, north or south." He drew briefly in the wet sand at their feet. "If he goes west he hits us. If he goes north he hits the Head. Mind you, if he could get past the Head he'd have a clear run northwest away up to Cleveland. That's why he was trying his sweeps an hour ago. A few hundred yards out to sea and he'd have been free. But what we knows, and what they doesn't, is there's a current. Hell of a current, rips down past the Head. They might as well stir the water with their ..." He paused, not sure how far informality could go."Why doesn't he go south?" cut in Godwin."He will. He's tried the sweeps, tried the sea-anchor to check his drift. It's my guess the one in charge, the <i>jarl</i> what they call them, he knows his men are exhausted. A rare old night they must have had of it. And a shock in the morning when they saw where they were." The reeve shook his head with a kind of professional sympathy."They are not such great sailors," pronounced Godwin with satisfaction. "And God is against them, foul, heathen Church-defilers."A stir of excitement behind them cut off the reply the reeve might have been incautious enough to make. The two men turned.On the path that ran along behind high-water mark, a dozen men were dismounting. The levy? thought Godwin. The thanes from Beverley? No, they could not possiblyhave arrived in this time. They must only now be saddling up. Yet the man in front was a nobleman. Big, burly, fair hair, bright blue eyes, with the upright stance of a man who had never had to plough or hoe for a living. Gold shone beneath his expensive scarlet cape, on buckles and sword-pommel. Behind him strode a smaller, younger version of himself, surely his son. And on the other side of him another youth, tall, straight-backed like a warrior. But dark in complexion, poorly dressed in tunic and wool breeches. Grooms held the horses for half a dozen more armed, competent-looking men--a retinue, surely, a rich thane's hearth-troop.The leading stranger held his empty hand up. "You do not know me," he said. "I am Wulfgar. I am a thane from King Edmund's country, from the East Angles."A stir of interest from the crowd, the dawnings his message might be of hostility."You wonder what I am doing here. I will tell you." He gestured out at the shore. "I hate Vikings. I know more of them than most men. And, like most men, to my sorrow. In my own country, among the North-folk beyond the Wash, I am the coast-guard, set by King Edmund. But long ago I saw that we would never get rid of these vermin while we English fought only our own battles. I persuaded my king of this, and he sent messages to yours. They agreed that I should come north, to talk with the wise men in Beverley and in Eoforwich about what we might do. I took a wrong road last night, met your messengers riding to Beverley this morning. I have come to help." He paused. "Have I your leave?"Godwin nodded slowly. Never mind what the lowborn fish-churl of a reeve said. Some of the bastards might come ashore. And if they did, this lot might well scatter. A dozen armed men just might be useful."Come and welcome," he said.Wulfgar nodded with deliberate satisfaction. "I am only just in time," he remarked.Ou...</p><h2>Playful Parenting: A Bold New Way to Nurture Close Connections, Solve Behavior Problems, and Encourage Children&#39;s Confidence</h2><p>Parents have heard that play is a child's work--but play is not for kids only. As psychologist Lawrence J. Cohen, Ph.D., demonstrates in this delightful new book, play can be the basis for an innovative and rewarding approach to parenting. From eliciting a giggle during baby's first game of peek-a-boo to cracking jokes with a teenager while hanging out at the mall, Playful Parenting is a complete guide to using play to raise strong, confident children.<br><br>Have you ever stepped back to watch what really goes on when your children play? As Dr. Cohen points out, play is children's complex and fluid way of exploring the world, communicating hard-to-express feelings, getting close to those they care about, working through stressful situations, and simply blowing off steam. That's why "playful parenting" is so important and so successful in building strong, close bonds between parents and children. Through play we join our kids in their world. We help them express and understand deep emotions, foster connection, aid the process of emotional healing--and have a great time ourselves while we're at it.<br><br>Anyone can be a playful parent--all it takes is a sense of adventure and a willingness to let down your guard and try something new. After identifying why it can be hard for adults to play, Dr. Cohen discusses how to get down on the floor and join children on their own terms. He covers games, activities, and playful interactions that parents can enjoy with children of all ages, whether it's gazing deep into a baby's eyes, playing chase with a toddler, fantasy play with a grade schooler, or reducing a totally cool teenager to helpless laughter.<br><br>Playful Parenting also includes illuminating chapters on how to use play to build a child's confidence and self-esteem, how to play through sibling rivalry, and how play can become a part of loving discipline. Written with love and humor, brimming with good advice and revealing anecdotes, and grounded in the latest research, Playful Parenting will make you laugh even as it makes you wise in the ways of being a happy, effective, enthusiastic parent.</p><p>Tag, you're it! In <i>Playful Parenting</i>, Lawrence Cohen demonstrates that parents need to lighten up and spend a few hours giggling with their kids. Play is inherently educational for children, he claims, and parents can learn plenty by examining the games kids play--from peekaboo to practical jokes. <p> Cohen is quick to point out that no matter what your child's temperament, she has a playful side. In its most basic form, play is a way to communicate. The author examines, with plenty of hilarious personal anecdotes, the details of play at every age and across genders. From his daughter and a new male friend discussing how "cool" nuclear weapons are and how "gross" a love song is, to a younger child zooming full-speed around a park at a birthday party, we're shown the exuberant truth behind playing: not only is it just plain fun, it can spark a variety of important sensations. One short section discusses the common phenomenon of happy giggling turning instantly to tears. Cohen suggests that "the fun play opens the emotional door to let out the giggles, and a flood of other feelings come pouring out after." Some specific ideas for games are included, and you'll find recommendations for everything from play wrestling to gentle storytelling. One chapter focuses on how to cope with play you don't find enjoyable, and how learning to appreciate these games can lead to surprising emotional insights. This is where Cohen's years of practice come in handy--it may be true that we all play, but not everyone immediately grasps the underlying messages. This is not simply a book filled with family activities, but rather an exploration of play for all ages. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>We all know we are supposed to turn off the TV and spend more time together. But then what? PLAYFUL PARENTING is a guide to having more fun with young people of all ages as they tackle new accomplishments, recover from being hurt, or are simply bursting with youthful exuberance. Through the practice of Playful Parenting&#x2014;joining children in their world, focusing on connection and confidence, giggling and roughhousing, reversing the roles and following your child&#x2019;s lead&#x2014;you will learn how to deal effectively with sibling rivalry and other tricky problems, and how to rethink your ideas about discipline and punishment. <p>Finally, in order to be fountains of hopefulness and enthusiasm for children, we must find ways to replenish ourselves. PLAYFUL PARENTING offers practical help in becoming the best parents, and the most playful parents, we can be. Parents can learn to balance the serious business of heartfelt connections with the silliness of wild play. PLAYFUL PARENTING can help solve a variety of family difficulties, but it is also for families where everything is going fine. It helps every child have more fun, and it&#x2019;s great for grown-ups. After all, we need to play, too.</p></p><h2>Soarer&#39;s Choice: The Sixth Book of the Corean Chronicles</h2><p><p><b>L. E.

To his left on the polished wood was a shorter stack&#x2014;the immediate orders he had written for the Myrmidons in an effort to undo the worst of his predecessor&#x2019;s plotting. Outside, the morning sunlight of late harvest warmed the courtyard and the blue-winged pteridons of First Company&#x2014;those that were not flying dispatches and undertaking other duties. The solid granite of the courtyard and the walls sparkled in the bright sun, clean and crisp.<br><br>He&#x2019;d permanently reassigned the Seventh Company of Myrmidons to Tempre from Dulka to keep them from being suborned by Quivaryt, the regional alector in Dulka, and clearly the tool of Brekylt, the Alector of the East in Alustre. After that had come the cover letter forwarding copies of Dainyl&#x2019;s appointment as marshal to each of the eight Myrmidon companies spread across Corus. Beside those lay the draft of his report on what he had done to quash the &#x201c;revolt&#x201d; in Hyalt and Tempre. Of course, he couldn&#x2019;t tell the entire story, because his superior, the High Alector of Justice, the most honorable Zelyert, had firmly ordered him to treat the matter as a local revolt, rather than the first thrust of a conspiracy masterminded by Brekylt. To make matters worse, and more delicate, Dainyl suspected that Brekylt was being quietly urged on by Samist, the Duarch of Ludar.<br><br>Dainyl looked up from the various papers and back out through the window at the nearest pteridon in the courtyard behind the headquarters building, standing on its wide raised stone square and stretching its blue leathery wings. The long crystalline beak glittered in the sunlight. After a moment, Dainyl&#x2019;s eyes dropped back to the papers before him.<br><br>Despite the proclamation that lay on his table desk and the green-edged gold stars on the collars of his blue and gray shimmersilk uniform that attested to his rank, Dainyl still didn&#x2019;t feel like the Marshal of Myrmidons.<br><br>Add to that the fact that he was dreading the translation trip to Alustre, but the longer he waited, the more dangerous the situation became, and it wasn&#x2019;t something he could delegate. For one thing, he didn&#x2019;t have anyone to whom he could delegate the task. He&#x2019;d been the submarshal in Elcien, and Colonel Dhenyr, who had been the Myrmidon operations director, had attempted to kill Dainyl when Dainyl had discovered Dhenyr&#x2019;s treachery. Dainyl was the only senior officer left in headquarters. The other submarshal, Alcyna, was stationed in Alustre, the width of the continent away. For years, she had directed Myrmidon operations in the east, and she was one of the reasons Dainyl had to go to Alustre&#x2014;and before long.<br><br>He took a deep breath and reached for the next document on the top of the taller pile. In less than a glass, he was due at the Palace of the Duarch in Elcien, to meet with Duarch Khelaryt to brief him personally on all that had happened in Hyalt and Tempre. He assumed that he would also be asked for his plans for the Myrmidons. That possibility worried him far more than explaining the past, because he doubted that it would be wise to reveal the reasons behind what he planned until he had a better idea of what the Duarch&#x2014;and those around him&#x2014;already knew.<br><br>Still, he needed to finish catching up on the other Myrmidon and Cadmian operations, or as many as he could, before he met with the Duarch. He began to read the report from Colonel Herolt, commander of the First Regiment, Cadmian Mounted Rifles.<br><br>When he finished, Dainyl couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. Except for Second Battalion, every battalion in the First Regiment was understrength, and the colonel was reporting that matters were worsening. And why in the Archon&#x2019;s name had a battalion been sent to Soupat? The mines there were marginal. At least he thought so, but it wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to ask Lystrana. As a chief assistant in the Palace of the Duarch, his wife might know the trade and finance background.<br><br>Slowly, he got up and headed for the records chamber.<br><br>Doselt, the squad leader in charge of records, then jumped to his feet. &#x201c;Yes, Marshal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you find me the records of and the orders to the First Cadmian Regiment that deal with the deployment of its Sixth Battalion to Soupat last season?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It might take a bit, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just bring them to me. If I&#x2019;m not here, leave them on the corner of my desk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl moved down the corridor to see if Captain Ghasylt was in his study. Dainyl needed some help, and he needed it now. Ghasylt might be out in the courtyard&#x2014;he spent more time flying or with the pteridons than did many company commanders. Dainyl was fortunate. The captain was standing by his desk, holding a report, looking at it quizzically.<br><br>He dropped it on the table. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ghasylt... you know that we have no operations director...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Ghasylt swallowed. &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir?&#x201d; Dainyl couldn&#x2019;t help smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a flier, sir. I can&#x2019;t do operations and scheduling and paperwork.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your reports are excellent,&#x201d; Dainyl pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t do them. Undercaptain Zernylta does. She has for years.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl laughed. &#x201c;I might steal her, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She writes well, sir. I&#x2019;d hate to lose her, but she&#x2019;d do better than I would.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s on the dispatch run from Ludar. She won&#x2019;t be back until late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would you leave word that I would like to see her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Ghasylt sounded disconsolate.<br><br>&#x201c;If she works out, she won&#x2019;t get jumped three ranks to colonel,&#x201d; Dainyl said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be a captain and assistant operations director.&#x201d; Of course, there might not be an operations director for a while, but Dainyl needed the job done. &#x201c;And you could still make majer... without doing much paperwork.&#x201d; He grinned. &#x201c;If you can find another undercaptain who can write.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ghanyr&#x2019;s not bad. Chelysta&#x2019;s nearly as good as Zernylta, but don&#x2019;t steal her. She&#x2019;s the best squad leader in the air.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl made a mental note to jot that down when he got back to his study. He could never tell when he might need another good company commander. He&#x2019;d also have to check on Ghasylt. He might be able to promote him to majer anyway. The commanding officer of the Elcien company probably ought to be one, and Dainyl needed a good flying commander and loyalty as much as he needed an operations officer. &#x201c;I appreciate the information, and even more, I appreciate your honesty and loyalty. These days, it means a great deal.&#x201d;<br><br>Although Ghasylt&#x2019;s expression remained politely attentive, Dainyl sensed the concealed surprise&#x2014;and gratitude.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to talk, before too long, about what may lie ahead for you and First Company.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl nodded, then turned and headed back toward his study. He didn&#x2019;t make it.<br><br>&#x201c;The duty coach is ready, sir!&#x201d; That was Undercaptain Yuasylt, the duty officer.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in a moment.&#x201d; Dainyl paused. There was nothing he really needed in his study. He turned and headed toward the archway to the front entrance.<br><br>Outside, waiting with the coach, was Wyalt. As always, the duty driver had a smile on his face when Dainyl strode out of headquarters. &#x201c;Good morning, Marshal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Wyalt. The Duarch&#x2019;s Palace.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl stepped up into the coach and closed the door.<br><br>Once the coach began to move, he concentrated on how best to brief the Duarch. Some of that would depend on whether Khelaryt wanted a private briefing or one that included other High Alectors.<br><br>As the duty coach neared the Duarch&#x2019;s Palace, Dainyl looked out at Elcien, a city built on an isle, of stone and tile and gardens and trees, orderly and vibrant, with stone-walled dwellings set on tree-lined streets, shops with their perfect tile roofs set around market squares that held everything produced on Acorus. Goods shipped from across the world flowed from the wharves and docks on the southern shore into endless warehouses and to everyone in Elcien, alectors and landers alike.<br><br>His eyes lingered on the twin green towers flanking the Palace, soaring into the silver-green sky, gleaming and glittering in the midmorning sunlight, symbolically crowning the accomplishments of the alectors of Acorus, who had turned a freezing and dying world into a place of life and achievement. Even as he marveled at the towers, Dainyl recalled the words of the ancient soarer. You must change, or you will die. That seemed so unlikely, yet the ancient had been so certain... and so melancholy in saying those words.<br><br>The coach slowed and came to a halt under the portico at the main entrance to the Duarch&#x2019;s Palace. Dainyl stepped out.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be waiting for you, sir,&#x201d; Wyalt called down from the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>Dainyl almost told him to return to headquarters because others might need him, but cut off the words before he spoke. There wasn&#x2019;t anyone there who would need the coach, not without a submarshal or an operations director. &#x201c;Thank you. I don&#x2019;t know how long I&#x2019;ll be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be here, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Dainyl made his way in through the archway, past the pair ...</p></p><h2>The Art of the Market</h2><p>A survey of the art of stock certificates traces fluctuations in the market, and the culture, for two hundred years.</p><p>Award-winning journalist Bob Tamarkin has been an investigative reporter and foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and Senior Editor and Midwest Bureau Chief for Forbes.

Sexing the Cherry is an imaginative tour de force exploring history, imagination, and the nature of time. In a fantastic world that is and is not seventeenth-century England, a baby is found floating in the Thames. The child is rescued by the Dog Woman, a murderous gentle giant who names her newfound trophy Jordan and takes him out for walks on a leash. When he grows up Jordan, like Gulliver, travels the world, but finds that the strangest wonders are spun out of his own head. The strangest wonder of all is Time. Does it exist? What is its nature? Why does every journey conceal another journey within its lines? What is the difference between seventeenth-century Jordan and twentieth-century Nicholas Jordan, a navel cadet in a warship? And who are the Twelve Dancing Princesses? With a story full of shimmering epiphanies, Jeanette Winterson again demonstrates the keenness of her craft and the singularity of her vision. <p>"Sexing the Cherry fuses history, fairy tale, and metafiction into a fruit . . . of a memorably startling flavor." -The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"The marvelous and the horrific, the mythic and the mundane overlap and intermingle in this wonderfully inventive novel."-The New York Times </p><p>"Sexing the Cherry is a dangerous jewel . . . a mixture of The Arabian Nights touched by the philosophical form of Milan Kundera and told with the grace of Italo Calvino."-San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"Sexing the Cherry is a firecracker. . . .

She is the daughter of a minister and has a special interest in church planting. Henderson lives in central Illinois.If timing is everything, Henderson has it in spades as she launches the second novel in her inspirational suspense/romance series Uncommon Heroes, spotlighting military maneuvers in the Middle East. Navy Lt. Grace "Gracie" Yates is a tough, blue-eyed brunette who has a passion for flying harrowing missions. She's on the radar screen of Air Force Maj. Bruce "Striker" Stanton, who is looking for a long-term relationship despite his and Gracie's military careers, which separate them for long stretches. Henderson avoids mushy romantic cliches almost to a fault her characters are chaste, even by conservative standards, and Bruce and Gracie's first kiss is as lukewarm as old dishwater. But fresh touches of humor mixed with hair-raising rescue scenes keep readers involved, and there's enough Scripture and God talk to please the CBA market. The characterizations are wonderfully done, right down to Bruce's elderly hound dog, Emily, although overlong stretches of dialogue dilute the quality of some of the writing. The pace is often mired in incomprehensible military jargon ("She'd been given vectors to a KC-135 tanker on angels 12 as a backup, but there wasn't a bright billboard to tell her where it was in its pattern"), but readers can bail themselves out by using the glossary provided, which will be well-thumbed by the final page. Henderson's military themes and her strong, career-minded female characters are fairly original for the CBA market, and this latest installment should help build steam for the series. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Murder in Saint-Germain (An Aim�e Leduc Investigation)</h2><p><b>A&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;National Bestseller<br>A BBC Best Summer Read of 2017<br><b>A&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;Best Book of 2017</b>&nbsp;<br><b>A Huffington Post Best Mystery of 2017</b></b><br><br>Paris, July 1999: Private investigator Aim�e Leduc is walking through Saint-Germain when she is accosted by Suzanne Lesage, a Brigade Criminelle agent on an elite counterterrorism squad.

He needed to prepare them for pollinating the garden&#x2019;s apple trees, acacias, and chestnuts that week. Under the birdsong he could already make out the low buzz coming from the gazebo that sheltered their wooden hives. As he approached, he passed gardeners piling scattered plane-tree branches, their boots sucking in the mud.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a mess. On top of the cleanup, he had a beekeeping class to teach here this afternoon. The buzzing mounted&#x2014;had a hive been knocked over in the wind? As he adjusted his netted headgear, he felt a lump, something squishing under his boot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pale, mud-splattered fingers&#x2014;a hand. Good God, he&#x2019;d stepped on a human hand protruding from the hedge surrounding the apiary. Horrified, he stepped back, pushed the dripping branches of the bushes aside. He gasped to see a woman sprawled in a sundress. One hand clutched her swollen throat; buzzing bees, like black-gold jewels, covered most of her body.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before he shouted to the gardeners for help, he knew it was too late.<br>&nbsp; <br><br> <i><b>Paris � Tuesday Morning</b><br></i>Aim�e Leduc&#x2019;s bare legs wrapped around Beno�t&#x2019;s spine as his tongue traced her ear. His warm skin and musk scent enveloped her. Delicious. Early morning sunlight pooled on her herringbone wood floor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t want him to stop. A sniffling cry came over the baby monitor. <i>Non. </i>The cry grew louder.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yours or mine?&#x201d; Beno�t sighed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She&#x2019;d know her daughter Chlo�&#x2019;s cry anywhere; these were the cries of Beno�t&#x2019;s niece, Gabrielle. &#x201c;Yours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the phones on the floor beeped. He looked at her again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mine,&#x201d; said Aim�e.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beno�t nuzzled her neck, disentangled himself, and found his shirt. She reached from where she lay on the duvet to the pile of clothes on the floor and found her cell phone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A voice mail. Unknown number. She dialed in, heard the tone, and waited. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dr. Vesoul.&#x201d; A clearing of the throat. &#x201c;Our patient, Commissaire Morbier, went into emergency surgery. We&#x2019;re calling the family. He was asking for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e&#x2019;s heart scudded. A knifelike pain wrenched her gut. Morbier. Her godfather . . . the man responsible for her father&#x2019;s murder.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man she&#x2019;d gotten shot two months earlier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who had taken her to ballet lessons when she was a child. The man who&#x2019;d lied to her for years.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go hear him lie again? Never, she told herself. Kept telling herself that as she slipped into the work outfit hanging in her armoire&#x2014;a black pencil skirt and white silk blouse&#x2014;and as her shaking fingers struggled with the straps of her Roger Vivier sandals.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bronze sunlight stippled the worn tiles on the kitchen floor. Miles Davis, Aim�e&#x2019;s bichon frise, licked<br> the spilled milk under Gabrielle&#x2019;s high chair. Holding her <i>b�b�</i>, Chlo�, on her hip, Aim�e handed Beno�t a freshly brewed espresso. He responded with a long kiss on her neck.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would have liked that to go on forever. His scent lingered in her hair. &#x201c;Tonight?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got meetings.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beno�t, a Sorbonne professor, tall and dark haired, lived across the courtyard at his sister and brother-in-law&#x2019;s. Stretching a long weekend, they&#x2019;d asked him to babysit. His niece, Gabrielle, shared a caregiver, Babette, with Chlo�. The babies were only a month apart in age.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Playing hard to get?&#x201d; she whispered. Stupid. Why couldn&#x2019;t she set boundaries, as the <i>ELLE </i>relationship article counseled? Keep him wanting more, not pull Gabrielle&#x2019;s uncle into her bed every night.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Look for me around eleven,&#x201d; he breathed in her ear. His hand slipped into her blouse and traced the edge of her lace bra. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring the champagne; you provide the chaos. And wear that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waved goodbye to Gabrielle, seated in her high chair, and greeted the arriving Babette, who chattered about her upcoming Greek vacation. Aim�e sat eight-month-old Chlo� in the high chair next to Gabrielle&#x2019;s&#x2014;like two peas in a pod; she never got over that. Chlo� mashed a raspberry in her pudgy fingers, then smeared it on the stuffed bunny Morbier had given her at her christening.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, Morbier&#x2019;s face flashed in Aim�e&#x2019;s head. She wanted to throw the bunny in the trash. But as she eased it from Chlo�&#x2019;s sticky hand, the baby emitted a little cry. <i>&#x201c;D�sol�e, ma puce.&#x201d; </i>Aim�e tossed the favorite bunny into the hamper.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could do this, couldn&#x2019;t she? Pull off being a working <i>maman. </i>She&#x2019;d scored with a sweet caregiver for Chlo� and a hunk who lived just across the courtyard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She flipped open her red Moleskine to her to-do list, half listening to Babette&#x2019;s vacation chatter. A<br> handwritten phone number glared up at her. Morbier&#x2019;s handwriting. Her insides trembled. Her godfather&#x2019;s presence was everywhere in her life. She pictured herself at his deathbed, imagined his accusations. Felt a beat of pain and drew a deep breath.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing at a time. Compartmentalize. Her goal these days was to put things into mental boxes, deal with the nonpriorities later. Hopefully, by the time she got to the most unpleasant item, it would have gone away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked up Chlo� and inhaled her sweet baby smell. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Give <i>maman </i>a <i>bisou</i>,&#x201d; said Babette, folding diapers by the window and puckering her lips.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlo� cooperated with a raspberry-scented slobber. Her daughter&#x2019;s grey-blue eyes were so like those of Melac, the girl&#x2019;s biological father, and reminded Aim�e of him every day. Melac had a new wife, and he and Aim�e had a custody truce&#x2014;life was good, wasn&#x2019;t it?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, in her sunlit kitchen, with the Seine gurgling below the window, Babette&#x2019;s bustling faded away. All Aim�e wanted to do on this muggy July day was sit back down and play with her rosy-cheeked Chlo�. Forget about the day ahead . . . and Morbier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her phone rang in the hallway.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;See you tonight, <i>ma puce.</i>&#x201d; She blew a kiss.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the coatrack she grabbed her trench coat, found her phone in her bag, and hit answer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>All�</i>, Aim�e? It&#x2019;s Jojo Dejouy. Got a moment?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old <i>commissaire </i>who&#x2019;d been a colleague of her father&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Morbier&#x2019;s. Not now of all times.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Oui</i>, can I call you later? I&#x2019;m off to work . . .&#x201d; She held the phone against her ear as she hurried down the marble stairs, grooved with age, to the ground floor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Morbier&#x2019;s asking for you, Aim�e. I thought you should know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First the doctor and now Jojo. She wanted to yell, <i>Leave me alone!</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not a good time, Jojo. <i>D�sol�e.</i>&#x201d; She shooed a stray black cat out of Chlo�&#x2019;s stroller, parked next to Gabrielle&#x2019;s by the stairs. Brushed off the cat hairs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence on Jojo&#x2019;s end of the line. Aim�e stepped over the courtyard&#x2019;s puddles. She held the phone between her shoulder and ear, dumping her bag in her motor scooter&#x2019;s basket.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know how you feel about Morbier,&#x201d; he said finally.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like hell he did. She checked the spark plug. Kicked the tires. Good enough.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much time,&#x201d; said Jojo. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t hear him out, I think you&#x2019;ll be saddled with more guilt than you feel already.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilt? &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the word I&#x2019;d use, Jojo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for your sake that I called, not his,&#x201d; said Jojo. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s you who&#x2019;s got to live with the consequences. Like I do. Never leave things unsaid, Aim�e. Come to terms with Morbier.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Alors . . .&#x201d; </i>Her heel skidded on a fallen pear from the courtyard tree. Crushed on the cobbles, the fruit emitted a sweet scent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wait, Aim�e.&#x201d; Jojo&#x2019;s voice rose. &#x201c;Your father meant a lot to me. I didn&#x2019;t show it when they kicked him off the force. That was wrong. To my last day, I&#x2019;ll regret that. But I know you&#x2019;re a bigger person than I am. You find the good in people. You&#x2019;re generous, like your father.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e wiped her heeled sandal on a cobble. &#x201c;Got to go,<br> Jojo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re afraid of his accusations?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve as good as killed him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The CRS shot him, not you. Morbier&#x2019;s an old dog,&#x201d; said Jojo, &#x201c;been around long enough to know the score.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hung up. Grabbed the handlebars of her faded pink Vespa so hard her knuckles hurt. Couldn&#x2019;t she put the past aside for once and get on with today?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet she&#x2019;d known Morbier all her life. She wondered what her father would have done.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mist filled the quai, the plane-tree leaves rustled, and a siren whined as she gunned over Pont de la Tournelle to the Left Bank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the good in people? Generous? She didn&#x2019;t feel generous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe she did want to hear whatever Morbier had to tell her. Could she face Morbier? Or would she end up kicking herself later? Would she regret it even more if she didn&#x2019;t hear him out?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the traffic light beyond the quai, she turned left instead of right, heading toward la Maison de Sant� du Gardien de la Paix, the pale brick police hospital that bordered the Latin Quarter. Of those who went in, half made it to the country rehab clinic; the rest came out in a box.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gathering clouds promised more rain after yesterday&#x2019;s storm. The humid heat was like a blanket lying over the streets. What she wouldn&#x2019;t give for a whiff of breeze. Her damp collar stuck to her neck, her fingers trembled, and she almost turned around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perspiration dried in the cleft of her neck. She&#x2019;d come this far. Determined, she hurried up the hospital stairs. A few minutes, that would be all. She&#x2019;d hear what Morbier wanted to tell her, then go.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool antiseptic-laced air met her in the old-fashioned wood-paneled lobby. Near the reception desk, she caught sight of Jeanne, Morbier&#x2019;s middle-aged girlfriend. Jeanne leaned against the wall, her hands covering her face. Too late?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disinfectant odors couldn&#x2019;t block the smell of two old men on Aim�e&#x2019;s left, each standing with the support of a walker. &#x201c;Good job. Take another step. We&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; said a perspiring young nurse. Aim�e recognized one of the men&#x2014;Philippe, from her father&#x2019;s old <i>commissariat</i>. A haggard face now, one side of him drooping, drool hanging from his chin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sobs came from another corridor. Aim�e shuddered and stepped back. Her fault, all her fault.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeanne saw her and beckoned. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That cold, wet night came back to her&#x2014;Morbier reaching for what she thought was his gun, her signaling the SWAT team, the shots, the blood, all that blood, Morbier wheeled into emergency surgery.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilt, sadness, and anger washed over her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e couldn&#x2019;t push that scuffed door open. Couldn&#x2019;t&nbsp; face his dying. She shook her head at Jeanne, felt a tear course down her cheek, and turned around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Aim�e, come back,&#x201d; yelled Jeanne.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A minute later, she&#x2019;d jumped on her scooter and taken off.</p><h2>The Civil War, Vol 1: Fort Sumter to Kernstown: First Blood - The Thing Gets Underway</h2><p>The Civil War, Vol 1: Fort Sumter to Kernstown: First Blood - The Thing Gets ...</p><p></p><h2>Brave New Weed: Adventures into the Uncharted World of Cannabis</h2><p><p>The former editor-in-chief of <em>Details </em>and <em>Star</em> adventures into the fascinating "brave new world" of cannabis, tracing its history and possible future as he investigates the social, medical, legal, and cultural ramifications of this surprisingly versatile plant.</p><p>Pot.

This book presents us with an opportunity to understand and apply the Scriptures in a more reliable way than any other: by studying under those saints who have communed directly, in deep ecstasy, with Christ and God.</p><p>How is one to understand the life and teachings of the great master Jesus, whose title "the Christ" meant the "anointed of God"? Tradition offers us two approaches: one, the authority of the Church; the other, that of historical analysis, which Christian scholars lately have been applying to certain recently discovered texts. <p>There is another approach, less widely known but more reliable than any other: It is to study the writings and sayings of, or better still to live with and study under, saints who have communed directly, in deep states of ecstasy, with Christ and God. Such persons are true spiritual masters. They have lived in every country, and have belonged to every religion and every social level. They have taught the Truth from their own deep realization. When they've been free to speak out, their impact has been widespread and profound. Often, unfortunately, freedom of speech has been denied them; they've had to submit to the control of religious superiors, who considered their own authority a supreme right bestowed on them by God.</p>A great spiritual master came from India, commissioned by Jesus Christ himself, to bring back "Original Christianity." <p>The "good news" of the Gospels is that we are all children of God and can ourselves know God. </p><p>What this book reveals: </p><p>Jesus, son of man, was a separate reality from Jesus, Son of God. </p><p>Though in essence both were one, Jesus, "son of man," had a delightful, if understated, sense of humor. No "man of sorrows," he was joyful, magnetic, and expressed himself with color and courage. He was the ideal human being, showing people their own divine potential, which is the underlying truth of all Creation. He urged us all, therefore, to aspire to "become as perfect as God," (Matthew 5:48) showing by example that soul-joy is our eternal birthright, and that, theerfore Satan can be overcome.</p></p><h2>A Wolf at the Table: A Memoir of My Father</h2><p><p>&#x201c;As a little boy, I had a dream that my father had taken me to the woods where there was a dead body.

But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes...I wasn&#x2019;t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?&#x201d;<i></i></p><p>When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.&nbsp; Something dark and secretive that could not be named.&nbsp; </p><p>Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten&#x2019;s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn&#x2019;t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested...</p><p>And then the &#x201c;games&#x201d; began. </p><p>With <i>A Wolf at the Table,</i> Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, <i>A Wolf at the Table</i> will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It&#x2019;s a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, April 2008: When I started reading <i>A Wolf at the Table</i>, I thought I knew what to expect. Augusten Burroughs captures intense experience with an inexplicably cool remove, imparting a stillness and purity to emotions that would likely run amok in anyone else's hands. I love this quality of his writing, and it's present in full force in this memoir of a childhood spent in thrall to a predatory and deeply unpredictable father. What I wasn't prepared for was the suspense--the dread-filled, nearly sonorous waiting for the worst to happen. An artful sort of bait-and-switch happens in the telling: Burroughs brings you to the brink of a terrible catharsis more than once, but the break in tension never comes. It is profoundly sad, remarkably tender, and fueled by a sense of love and reverence that only a child knows. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br>Augusten Burroughs is the author of <i>Running with Scissors</i>, <i>Dry</i>, <i>Magical Thinking: True Stories</i>, <i>Possible Side Effects</i> and <i>You Better Not Cry</i>.

In an industry where egomania and arrogance are apparently the norm, this case is extreme. The authors portray boy-wonder producers and directors John Landis and Steven Spielberg especially negatively. Landis, who used the children for illegal night filming, and four others, were tried on criminal charges and found innocent.

In <i>Shadows in the Sun</i>, he brings all of those gifts to bear on a fascinating examination of indigenous cultures and the interactions between human societies and the natural world.Ranging from the British Columbian wilderness to the jungles of the Amazon and the polar ice of the Arctic Circle, <i>Shadows in the Sun</i> is a testament to a world where spirits still stalk the land and seize the human heart. Its essays and stories, though distilled from travels in widely separated parts of the world, are fundamentally about landscape and character, the wisdom of lives drawn directly from the land, the hunger of those who seek to rediscover such understanding, and the consequences of failure.As Davis explains, "To know that other, vastly different cultures exist is to remember that our world does not exist in some absolute sense but rather is just one model of reality. The Penan in the forests of Borneo, the Vodoun acolytes in Haiti, the jaguar Shaman of Venezuela, teach us that there are other options, other possibilities, other ways of thinking and interacting with the earth." <i>Shadows in the Sun</i> considers those possibilities, and explores their implications for our world.</p><p>Renowned anthropologist Wade Davis shows us how preserving the diversity of the world's cultures and spiritual beliefs is just as important as preserving our endangered plants, insects, and animals. In this collection of personal essays, Davis tells of dramatic personal adventures during which he visits and often lives with indigenous communities in the remote regions of the world. He offers reports of toad-smoking shamanistic journeys in the Amazon forests, tracking an elusive cloud leopard in the mountains of Tibet, and a soulful lament for the lost American buffalo.<p> Although he has been called a modern-day Indiana Jones, Davis has far more integrity. His stories are not in service to self-glorification, but rather to one resounding theme: </p><blockquote>If there is one lesson I have drawn from my travels, it is that cultural and biological diversity are far more than the foundation of stability; they are an article of faith, a fundamental truth that indicates the way things are supposed to be.... There is a fire burning over the Earth, taking with it plants and animals, cultures, languages, ancient skills, and visionary wisdom. Quelling this flame and reinventing the poetry of diversity is the most important challenge of our times.</blockquote> <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"One of the intense pleasures of travel is the opportunity to live among people who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, recognize its taste in the bitter leaves of plants."<br><br>In this riveting collection of stories and essays, gifted scientist, anthropologist, and writer Wade Davis offers a captivating look at indigenous cultures around the world--from the nomadic Penan of Malaysia to the Vodoun practitioners of Haiti--and a poetic, timely examination of the rapport between humans and the natural world. Traveling from the mountains of Tibet to the jungles of the Amazon, Davis delves into the mysteries of shamanic healing, experiences first-hand hallucinogenic plants, explores the vanishing Borneo rain forests, and describes the ingenuity of the Inuit as they hunt narwhale on the Arctic ice.<br><br>A compelling and utterly unique celebration of the beauty and diversity of our planet, <b>Shadows in the Sun</b> is about landscape and character, the wisdom of lives drawn directly from the land, and the hunger of those who seek to rediscover such understanding. Davis shows that preserving the diversity of the world's cultures and spiritual beliefs is as important as preserving endangered plants and animals--and vital to our understanding of who we are.</p><h2>The Great Hunger (Penguin Modern)</h2><p><p><i>'I have lived in important places, times</i><br><i>When great events were decided . . .'</i></p><p>By turns comical, grouchy and exalted, and including his tragic masterpiece 'The Great Hunger', some of the key poems by the writer who transformed Anglo-Irish verse.</p><p>Penguin Modern: fifty new books celebrating the pioneering spirit of the iconic Penguin Modern Classics series, with each one offering a concentrated hit of its contemporary, international flavour.

The <i>Charleston Post and Courier</i> proclaims Elizabeth Peters &#x201c;a mistress of plot,&#x201d; while the <i>New York Times Book Review </i>declares, &#x201c;Amelia remains an irrepressible delight.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Named 1998 Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America, Elizabeth Peters is also a doctor of Egyptology whose mysteries have submerged readers in the vivid turn-of-the-century world of Amelia Peabody. In <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> Peters captures the immediacy of uncovering a new Egyptian tomb within the context of a tightly plotted murder investigation involving the entire Emerson Peabody clan. The characters, including Amelia's husband, Radcliffe Emerson, and her gifted son, Ramses, are meticulously drawn. As in previous novels the dialogue is reminiscent of <i>The Thin Man</i>. When a man calls out to passing suffragettes, "You ought to be 'ome washin' your 'usband's trousers!" Ramses shoots back, "I assure you, sir, the lady's trousers are not in such sore need of laundering as your own." Peters also toys with differing narrative perspectives, and Ramses emerges as a possible successor to his mother's legacy of crime solving.<p> <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> begins in 1907 in England where Amelia is attending a suffragettes' rally outside the home of Mr. Geoffrey Romer of the House of Commons. It seems Romer is one of the few remaining private collectors of Egyptian antiquities, and a series of bizarre events at the protest soon embroil Amelia in grave personal danger. Suspecting that the Master Criminal, Sethos, is behind their problems, the Emerson Peabodys hasten to Egypt to continue their studies in the Valley of Kings where they soon acquire a papyrus of the <i>Book of the Dead</i>. As with past seasons, however, their archaeological expedition is interrupted. The murdered body of a woman is found in the Nile. Ramses, Radcliffe, and Amelia all have their theories as to the origin of the crime, but their own lives might soon be at stake if the cult of Thoth and their ancient book is, indeed, involved.</p><p> Other Peabody mysteries include <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Hippopotamus Pool</i>, <i>The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog</i>, <i>The Deeds of the Disturber</i>, <i>Lion in the Valley</i>, <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs</i>, and <i>Crocodile on the Sandbank</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Join Amelia Peabody on her thrilling new expedition to the Valley of the Kings--Your Itinerary: Upper Egypt, 1907.

It's tempting to focus on pursuing money and fame, rather than the process itself. But as Srini Rao warns, creating then turns into a chore that can harm your self-esteem and suck the pleasure out of life, rather than being a source of joy.<br><br>Rao, host of the podcast The Unmistakable Creative, argues that we should counter this thinking by intentionally creating art for ourselves alone--an audience of one. In this book he shares the fascinating true stories of creatives who took this path, along with actionable tips and the research of creativity experts. You'll learn, for example:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;How Oprah's intentional focus on her own work rather than the opinions of everyone else catapulted her into one of the most popular talk shows of all time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;How being process-driven can not only help you produce more work, but can make you happier outside of your creative time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;How to put together a creative "team of rivals" whose feedback can help you hone your craft and filter out useless feedback.<br><br>By playing to an audience of one, we can find more happiness, increased productivity, and a greater sense of community.</p><p>Srinivas Rao is the host and founder of the popular podcast, the Unmistakable Creative, where he&#39;s interviewed over five hundred creative people. Former guests on the show include Seth Godin, Elle Luna, Tim Ferriss, Gretchen Rubin, Simon Sinek, Adam Grant, and Danielle LaPorte. His self-published book The Art of Being Unmistakable was a Wall Street Journal bestseller.Writer Karan Bajaj's mother was a schoolteacher and his father was an engineer. As is common in Indian culture, he was supposed to become either a doctor or an engineer. He said, "For the first twenty-two years of my life I didn't think at all, I had no independent thought at all of who I wanted to be. I was just following the path that was laid out in front of me, which was get into engineering college, then business school, and become an engineer." But he started writing ten years ago at age twenty-eight, and published his first novel at twenty-nine.<br><br>In 2013, the film rights for his second novel were optioned and he signed a book contract for his third novel. Despite many people encouraging him to pursue his passion for writing in light of his success, he has kept his day job. He feels it is his dharma, or calling, to be in business. He told me in our conversation that not tying his passion to money was one of the best decisions he ever made. He said, "It's been very liberating for me to answer my deepest questions through my writing. I never write for my niche, my industry, my audience, my platform. In a sense I think that's been the reason for the success of my writing."<br><br>Bajaj's story is exemplary of the possibilities that open in our lives when we're willing to embrace creativity for its own sake rather than external recognition. The creative process-not the result-is the source of our happiness. We feel the joy of being so immersed and engaged in what we're doing that we lose track of time. We experience moments of creative daring, beautiful magic, and the unexpected surprises that show up along the way. Fortunately, our commitment to and belief in the process is entirely in our control. We can decide to show up, sit down, and create. If we listen to the process of creativity and stay attentive, it can be our gateway to meaning.<br><br>The Downside of Rewards over Process<br><br>Paradoxically, when we're excessively focused on potential rewards rather than the process, the product suffers.<br><br>If a podcaster is thinking about the potential downloads while conducting an interview, the quality of the interview declines. They're no longer present, conversations come across as canned, and they end up trying to sound impressive as opposed to inspiring or informative.<br><br>If an author is thinking about reviews and bestseller lists while writing, the quality of their books declines. It places their focus on elements of creative work that are completely out of their control. What makes a great piece of writing great is an unwavering commitment to the craft, not the prize.<br><br>If a musician is thinking about their potential Grammy Award while recording an album, the quality of the music suffers. They try to live up to other people's expectations and their work ends up feeling forced and inauthentic.<br><br>Somewhere in the middle of 2014, all of my work started to become about feeding my ego and getting external validation. I wanted the approval of my mentor, my audience, and the world at large. All I cared about was our bottom line. In that process the work I loved turned into the job I hated, and what had once been one of my greatest sources of joy was making me miserable.<br><br>We must learn to let go of our attachments and expectations if we're going to derive satisfaction from our work and create art that we're proud to put our signature on.<br><br>When we value product over process, we depart from what psychologist and author Carol Dweck calls a growth mind-set. With a growth mind-set, you believe that you can continue to grow and learn. With a fixed mind-set, any perceived flaws or strengths are seen as permanent. We believe our well-being is determined entirely by what's out of our control, and our motivation and effort all begin to dwindle.<br><br>Because of the rapid pace at which we can go from idea to execution in the digital world, this is an all too common occurrence for people who start creative projects on the internet. When an enthusiastic start doesn't translate into an overnight success, people give up on their creative work. They don't give their efforts enough time to experience any visible progress and inaccurately conclude that they lack the necessary creativity or talent. They overlook the fact that nearly every "overnight success" is usually years in the making.<br><br>When we focus on end results, we essentially defeat one of the main benefits of creative work: to derive joy from the work itself. Our well-being fluctuates based on the outcomes. If temporary setbacks appear permanent, any effort appears to be completely fruitless.<br><br>On the flip side, when we focus on the process, we see opportunities for improvement. Opportunities for improvement elicit action, effort, and enthusiasm. It's in "the thousands of days of trying, failing, sitting, thinking, resisting, dreaming, raveling, unraveling, that we are at our most engaged, alert, and alive," says Dani Shapiro, memoirist and author of Still Writing: The Perils and Pleasures of a Creative Life.<br><br>By sticking with the process, we also increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome or product.<br><br>Here's an example: When our content strategist, Kingshuk Mukherjee joined the Unmistakable Creative team, his first major assignment was launching an interactive online course. Everything from the final product to the marketing and sales was based on his recommendations, but he had little control over the outcome (revenue generated from the launch). Reflecting on the launch, he said:<br><br>You're taking on a new project and your results will dictate how much you get paid. Now, the more time you put into it, the more you have to lose. A bad outcome means not only will you not get paid, but you'll lose all the time you invested. So there I was writing three to four versions of a landing page, a bit more than I've ever taken on before. If I thought about how bad I need to nail the final version, I'd choke-I wouldn't perform at all. So instead, I looked at "What do I have to accomplish RIGHT NOW to make this project a win?"<br><br>He focused on the process and ultimately ended up with a successful outcome (an increase in revenue).<br><br>The process is in our control. The process results in progress, which in turn increases our motivation. External outcomes, on the other hand, are not. And if the only measure we have for our success is the external outcome, and we don't see it materializing, we're likely to give up or just get bored with the work.<br><br>If you see your creative work as a chore, an obligation, or solely as an item to cross off your to-do list, the work will feel that way to you and anybody who interacts with it. On the other hand, if you see your work as a gift, a privilege, an opportunity to share the truth of what's in your heart with the world, that's the experience you'll have with it. Same work, different perspectives.<br><br>For example, in 2003, Frank Warren, who had started a small business called Instant Information Systems, was in Paris when he had a powerful lucid dream about three postcards he had bought that day. Purely as a creative experiment, he was led to print three thousand anonymous stamped and self-addressed postcards, blank on one side. On the other side he listed some simple instructions to "anonymously share an artful secret they've never shared before." He handed them out to people randomly on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect. The idea went viral, and Frank started receiving postcards from thousands of people from around the world. "In a weird way, the secrets give me strength," he said in an interview on Mediabistro.com. Today PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free site in the world with more than 200 million visitors. In addition to having no ads, no products can be purchased on PostSecret. As the absentee owner of Instant Information Systems, Warren has no need to monetize his creative endeavor.<br><br>In fact, based on PostSecret's success, Warren has been able to raise awareness and money for a nonprofit suicide prevention organization. Warren is a clear example of the power of creativity for its own sake as well as giving back to others. When our work feels like a gift to others instead of an obligation, it gives us something to look forward to every day. It inspires us as much as it does the audience we create it for.<br><br>If outcomes become the primary way of measuring our creative success, and those outcomes are not to our liking, our creativity goes from being something that adds energy, joy, and enthusiasm to our life to something that drains it. We simply go through the motions, eventually losing our motivation.<br><br>Listen to: Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>But unless we are creators we are not fully alive. What do I mean by creators? Not only artists, whose acts of creation are the obvious ones of working with paint or clay or words. Creativity is a way of living life, no matter our vocation or how we earn our living. Creativity is not limited to the arts, or having some kind of important career.<br><br>The Myth of "Making It"<br><br>When my self-published book The Art of Being Unmistakable gained the attention of media pundit Glenn Beck, I was suddenly in the spotlight like I'd never been before. My book was selling thousands of copies, I was receiving checks from Amazon far larger than anything I'd ever imagined, and it felt like I could do no wrong. But a few months later, everything was back to normal. I was confronted with the next challenge: letting go of my ego-driven desire for external validation and getting back to work like none of this had ever happened.<br><br>The myth of "making it" causes many aspiring creatives to believe that there will be a day when they no longer have to do the work that has gotten them to where they are. Those who buy into this myth and rest on their laurels become victims of their own success. They don't stand the test of time.<br><br>For instance, author and journalist Jonah Lehrer was on track to have a prolific career. He was a regular contributor at major media outlets like Wired magazine, had written multiple books, and was a frequent keynote speaker. However, it eventually surfaced that he had put made-up Bob Dylan quotes in one of his books, and he was eventually outed as a "serial fabricator." Lehrer later described his career as a "mixture of insecurity and ambition" that led him to stop doing the original creative work that had gotten him to where he was in the first place. He became a victim of his own success.<br><br>[AU: echo]<br><br>As author Ryan Holiday said to me in an interview on The Unmistakable Creative, success gives you the conditional opportunity to try again. We have to begin every new creative endeavor with the same enthusiasm and commitment regardless of the results from our previous efforts.<br><br>The act of creation contains a sense of fulfillment that we'll never get from any fleeting external outcome. Consider: A book on the New York Times bestseller list this week may be forgotten by next week. The box office smash eventually becomes a footnote. Today's viral sensation has vanished by the time you wake up tomorrow.<br><br>When we are dependent on anything external to fuel our creativity, we're effectively handing over control of our lives and happiness to that external reward. When the reward vanishes, so, too, does our creativity.<br><br>Our creativity can provide us with something to look forward to every day and a lasting sense of fulfillment. Why is the creative process itself so fulfilling?<br><br>Listen to: Sarah Joy Shockey<br><br>Anything you create that brings you joy or even frustration shapes you into someone with experience.<br><br>Creativity Makes Us Happy<br><br>The idea that creativity increases happiness isn't just a theory or an artsy opinion: A number of research studies have proved a strong link between creativity and happiness.<br><br>In our formal education system, creativity is primarily seen as an extracurricular activity, yet students derive tremendous benefit from a curriculum that includes the arts.<br><br>In 2014, University of North Carolina at Greensboro professor of psychology Paul Silvia and his colleagues published a paper called "Everyday Creativity in Daily Life: An Experience-sampling Study of 'Little C' Creativity." Their thesis was that "everyday creativity-creative actions that are common among ordinary people in daily life, such as drawing, making recipes, writing, and any activity done with the purpose of being creative-both fosters and reflects psychological health."<br><br>Seventy-nine college students participated in the weeklong study, in which they were asked whether they were doing something creative and to describe their emotional state at the moment. When participants were being creative, they reported feeling significantly happier and more active. Everyday creativity "allows people to explore their identities, form new relationships, cultivate competence, and reflect critically on the world. In turn, the new knowledge, self-insight, and relationships serve as sources of strength and resilience."<br><br>You might assume that you have to be a capital-A artist, painter, or poet "creative genius" in order to benefit from the creativity-happiness connection. But as Pacific Standard staff writer Tom Jacobs noted in his analysis of the Greensboro study, "you don't have to be a master poet or painter to reap the emotional rewards."<br><br>Creativity, it turns out, doesn't just contribute to our happiness but also to our mental and physical health. Expressing ourselves creatively is a form of self-care in many ways. It gives us the opportunity for self-reflection. And as we build our creative skills, we build confidence. Many therapists even prescribe creative expression to their patients for healing purposes.<br><br>For instance, in a study called "How Art Changes Your Brain," twenty-eight people between the ages of sixty-two and seventy were "encouraged to produce visual art and find their own forms of personal expression." During the ten-week study, an art educator introduced drawing and painting methods and materials, which allowed the participants to experiment however they wished.<br><br>Such visual art interventions, which were designed to test how art could affect aging, resulted in:<br><br>Reduced distress<br><br>Increased self-reflection<br><br>Normalized heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels<br><br>A study of Mindfulness Based Art Therapy (MBAT), a method that integrates mindfulness meditation skills and aspects of art therapy into an eight-week program for women with cancer, produced similar results. Participants in the study experienced significant decreases in symptoms of distress (anxiety, depression, hostility, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies) and significant improvements in key aspects of health-related quality of life (physical functioning, bodily pain, and mental health).</p><h2>Oresama Teacher, Vol. 11 (11)</h2><p>Can she clean up her act and still kick some butt?<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style). <br><br> Mafuyu is the no-nonsense, take-charge and hard-hitting leader of her high school gang.

She can&#39;t think of a worse fate than a rustic outing in a Wisconsin resort where she discovers a corpse, seemingly bludgeoned by a frying pan. When the body disappears and the &#34;victim&#34; reappears, Jane sets out to find out what&#39;s going on in this wacky wilderness wonderland.</p><p>In <i>Fear of Frying</i> neighbors Jane Jeffry and Shelly Nowack set off for some relaxation in the Wisconsin woods while scouting summer camp sites for suburban high-school students. Jane isn't exactly thrilled at the idea: any form of camping is an anathema at the best of times, and in damp midwinter it seems especially grim. Matters do not improve when this pair of amateur detectives discover one of their fellow campers smacked with a frying pan--seemingly with fatal consequences. But they suspect their own eyes (and everyone else suspects their sanity) when the body disappears along with any evidence of foul play. To make matters worse (or better) a surprisingly healthy victim resurfaces. With a mix of resentment at not being believed and amazement at the turn of events, the would-be campers are determined to discover what is really going on at their apparently secure haven in the wilderness.<p> Jill Churchill is a pen name for historical novelist Janice Young Brooks. <i>Fear of Frying</i> is the ninth in her Jane Jeffry series; the first, <i>Grime and Punishment</i>, won both the Agatha Award and the Macavity Award for Best First Mystery Novel. <i>Fear of Frying</i> is one of the stronger in the series--the fringe characters strike just the right note between parody and believability--and Jane and Shelly investigate matters more convincingly by relying on their memories and knowledge rather than by asking brash questions. The brightness and charm remain consistent: these suburban moms love children and dogs, a good gossip and decadent food--although not necessarily in that order.

The Silmarillion is an account of the Elder Days, of the First Age of Tolkien&#39;s world. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part. The tales of The Silmarillion are set in an age when Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-Earth, and the High Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils, the jewels containing the pure light of Valinor. Included in the book are several shorter works. The Ainulindale is a myth of the Creation and in the Valaquenta the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabeth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings. For the first time, we are publishing a deluxe edition of this pivotal work, featuring the revised, corrected text and including, by way of an introduction, a fascinating letter written by Tolkien in 1951 in which he gives a full explanation of how he conceived the early Ages of Middle-earth. Bound in cloth and leather, and set in a cloth-bound slipcase, this attractive edition will prove a fine addition to any Tolkien collection.</p><p><i>The Silmarillion</i> is J.R.R. Tolkien's tragic, operatic history of the First Age of Middle-Earth, essential background material for serious readers of the classic Lord of the Rings saga. Tolkien's work sets the standard for fantasy, and this audio version of the "Bible of Middle-Earth" does <i>The Silmarillion</i> justice. Martin Shaw's reading is grave and resonant, conveying all the powerful events and emotions that shaped elven and human history long before Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf and all the rest embarked on their quests. Beginning with the Music of the Ainur, <i>The Silmarillion</i> tells a tale of the Elder Days, when Elves and Men became estranged by the Dark Lord Morgoth's lust for the Silmarils, pure and powerful magic jewels. Even the love between a human warrior and the daughter of the Elven king cannot defeat Morgoth, but the War of Wrath finally brings down the Dark Lord. Peace reigns until the evil Sauron recovers the Rings of Power and sets the stage for the events told in the Lord of the Rings. This is epic fantasy at its finest, thrillingly read and gloriously unabridged. (Running time: 14 hours, 6 CDs)<p>Tolkien's epic legendary precursor to'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' </p><p>The Silmarilli were three perfect jewels, fashioned by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. When the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, stole the jewels for his own ends, Feanor and his kindred took up arms and waged a long and terrible war to recover them. This is the story of their rebellion against the gods and the history of the heroic First Age of Middle-earth. </p><p>"At times rises to the greatness of true myth."FINANCIAL TIMES </p><p>"A creation myth of singular beauty magnificent."WASHINGTON POST</p></p><h2>Kare Kano: His and Her Circumstances, Vol. 2</h2><p>After Soichiro threatens Yukino&#39;s status as most popular, Yukino tries to regain her idol-like popularity, struggling with her own inner problems while they develop a unique relationship.</p><p></p><h2>Everyday Sacred: A Woman&#39;s Journey Home</h2><p>Offering suggestions on how to experience a full life in a stressful world, the author of Plain and Simple utilizes Zen imagery and inspirational quotes to demonstrate how to live with &#34;just enough.&#34; $100,000 ad/promo.

Bender was shocked, realizing that nothing we accomplish seems like enough in our overly pressured world. In <i>Everyday Sacred</i> we follow Bender on her quest to make every moment enough. Cleaning a desk, sipping cappuccino, making computer connections, and appreciating freshly painted walls all become opportunities to satiate one's life with sacred encounters. The end product reads like an Amish quilt--simple vignettes sewn together to create a comfortable lifetime companion.<br>Sue Bender is the author of <i>Plain and Simple: A Woman's Journey to the Amish</i> (HarperSanFrancisco). The book was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. A fascination with Amish quilts led Sue to live with the Amish in their seemingly timeless world, a landscape of immense inner quiet. This privilege, rarely bestowed upon outsiders, taught her about simplicity and commitment and the contentment that comes from accepting who you are. In this inspiring book, Bender shares the lessons she learned while in the presence of the Amish people.<p>In <i>Everyday Sacred: A Woman's Journey Home</i> (HarperSanFrancisco: now in its sixth printing), Bender speaks to our longing to make each day truly count. She chronicles her struggle to bring the joyful wisdom and simplicity she experienced in her sojourn with the Amish back to her hectic, too-much-to-do days at home. Bender discovers for herself, and in the process shows us, that small miracles can be found everywhere'in our homes, in our daily activities and, hardest to see, in ourselves.</p><p>Profiles and interviews with Ms. Bender, as well as book excerpts have been published in countless national publications including <i>Reader's Digest</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Ladies' Home Journal, The Chicago Tribune, The Utne Reader</i>, and <i>W Magazine</i>.

In search of answers, Jeff goes undercover as a groom on the backstretch at Belmont Park racetrack in New York.

Among his numerous awards are three Edgar Awards, the Crime Writers' Association Cartier Diamond Dagger, and the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. He died in February 2010 at the age of 89.1 <br><br>Where are those goddamn cops?&#x201d; Tony Andretti said it under his breath, quiet as a whisper, but it was full of frustration nonetheless.<br><br>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; I murmured back. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be here soon enough.&#x201d;<br><br>Tony and I were lying side by side, out of sight in the bushes, next to a rest area off the A34 highway north of Oxford. We&#x2019;d been in position for several hours, getting ever wetter thanks to the persistent rain.<br><br>&#x201c;Call them in now, Jeff,&#x201d; Tony hissed at me angrily. &#x201c;Or we&#x2019;ll lose them.&#x201d;<br><br>I ignored him and went on watching through my binoculars.<br><br>Two men were standing in the rest area, between the cars in which they had recently arrived, their heads bent close together as if they didn&#x2019;t want to be overheard. Not that there was much chance of that, I thought, not with a line of heavy trucks �thundering past noisily on the divided highway only a dozen or so yards away.<br><br>One of the men, the shorter of the two, removed a white envelope from his pocket and handed it to the other, who then turned away from the road, conveniently facing directly toward me, as he counted the banknotes it contained.<br><br>I used the camera built into my binoculars to take a couple of still shots as the man thumbed through the wad, then I switched to video mode and zoomed in, first on the money in the man&#x2019;s hands and then up to his face. The light wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but my top-of-the-line digital system would be well able to cope.<br><br>Obviously satisfied with its contents, the taller man stuffed the white envelope into his anorak and then handed over a small, flat package. I filmed it all.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Nigel,&#x201d; I said quietly but distinctly into the microphone taped to my left wrist.<br><br>I went on filming as the two men briefly shook hands and then started to return to their respective cars.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re losing them,&#x201d; Tony said to me in an irritated tone.<br><br>I was beginning to think that he might be right, that I&#x2019;d left it to too late, when a couple of police squad cars arrived at speed screeching to a halt and blocking the vehicles in the rest area. Even before the cars had come to a complete stop, the doors were flung open and four uniformed officers spilled out.<br><br>The shorter of the two men stood stock-still, openmouthed in disbelief, but the taller one turned and ran&#x2014;away from the police and straight for me, at the same time removing a long-bladed knife from his coat pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;Knife!&#x201d; Tony shouted loudly beside me as he struggled to stand up.<br><br>The man changed from looking back at the police to looking toward where Tony and I had been hiding. He saw Tony, who was now on his feet, and turned slightly to go directly for him, the blade facing upward in his left hand in a manner that suggested to me that he knew exactly how to use it.<br><br>I rolled over, grabbed Tony by the ankles and pulled hard.<br><br>He came down on top of me, his considerable bulk sprawling over my legs.<br><br>&#x201c;Let go of me,&#x201d; Tony shouted angrily, trying to kick out toward my face.<br><br>I hung on tight.<br><br>The man with the knife hurdled over the two of us and ran off into the trees behind us, pursued by a pair of the policemen.<br><br>They&#x2019;re welcome to him, I thought, even with their anti-stab vests. I&#x2019;d been on the wrong end of a carving knife once before and had no wish to repeat the experience.<br><br>I released Tony&#x2019;s legs and we clambered to our feet.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell were you doing,&#x201d; Tony shouted at me, his face puce with rage. &#x201c;I could have had him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d have had you, more like,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Better to live to fight another day.&#x201d;<br><br>Tony stood staring at me, his hands bunched into fists, adrenaline still coursing through his veins. I stared back at him.<br><br>Slowly he relaxed and his fingers uncurled.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks. But I&#x2019;d have taken him down if I&#x2019;d had a piece.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tony, you&#x2019;re no longer with the NYPD.&#x201d;<br><br>As a younger man, Tony had been a cop, one of &#x201c;New York&#x2019;s Finest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get my head round you Brits and guns. Not even your cops carry them. You&#x2019;re just asking to get yourselves killed.&#x201d;<br><br>I resisted pointing out to him that in the previous ten years only a handful of British police officers had been killed on duty whereas hundreds of American cops had died in the same �period.<br><br>The two remaining police officers arrested the shorter of the men and were applying handcuffs to his wrists while relieving him of the package, which was then carefully enclosed in a plastic evidence bag.<br><br>Nigel had followed the police in his own car and was now standing to one side, watching. Tony and I went over to join him.<br><br>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; I said, slapping Nigel gently on the back.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re certainly a cool one, and no mistake,&#x201d; Nigel said, smiling at me. &#x201c;It was as much I could do to stop the boys in blue turning up as soon as they knew the men had arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled back at him. Nigel Green was a colleague of mine in&nbsp;the Integrity Department of the BHA&#x2014;the British Horseracing �Authority&#x2014;and we had together spent several weeks setting up this operation after a tip-off. We had been surprised that the police had been so cooperative, agreeing to wait on a farm road with Nigel until I called them in. Word of our past successes, when they alone had previously failed, had clearly filtered up to the powers that be.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn right, he&#x2019;s cool,&#x201d; Tony said. &#x201c;Nerves of steel. I&#x2019;d have called the cops in far sooner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not cool,&#x201d; I said jokily. &#x201c;At least, not in that sense.&#x201d; In&nbsp;temperature terms, I was extremely cool, and very wet. I shivered. &#x201c;If the posse had turned up before the package was handed over, we wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to implicate both men. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think those guys will get their man?&#x201d; Tony asked in his rich New York accent, looking over his shoulder toward the woods.<br><br>&#x201c;Eventually,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If not today, then sometime soon. I have all the evidence we need on disk.&#x201d; I tapped the binoculars/�camera around my neck.<br><br>The arrested man was frog-marched past us toward the police cars by the two tall officers who made him look even smaller than he actually was.<br><br>He stared at me with hatred in his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Hinkley, you&#x2019;re a bastard.&#x201d; He said it with feeling.<br><br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t get mixed up with drugs, Jimmy,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>The man was placed in the back of the police car.<br><br>&#x201c;He knows you, then?&#x201d; Tony said to me.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed he does,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Jimmy and I have crossed swords before.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Robinson was a jockey&#x2014;quite a good jockey&#x2014;who had previously tested positive for cocaine and been banned from riding for six months as a result. That had been two years ago, but he had clearly not learned his lesson.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you always worked undercover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I used to, but things change.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a consequence of being a long time on the job. When I&#x2019;d first started as an investigator at the BHA, fresh out of the army, I worked my entire time incognito, often using false beards and glasses to ensure that, even if I were seen, no one would recognize me again. But gradually, over time, my name and face were slowly put together by the racing fraternity and my covert work was now limited, although I could still occasionally get away with it, provided I employed some of my more elaborate disguises.<br><br>It was a situation I was not happy with. I had enjoyed living in the shadows rather than in the spotlight.<br><br>For some time I had even considered leaving the BHA altogether, packing up and moving abroad, possibly to Australia, to start again where my face was unknown.<br><br>The two policemen returned from the woods empty-handed, which didn&#x2019;t please Tony.<br><br>&#x201c;They should have caught him,&#x201d; he said to me. &#x201c;Your cops need to be fitter.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought that was rather rich, coming from him. Tony could hardly run fast enough to catch a cold. He had clearly put on far more than the odd pound since his days on the force.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to call the dogs out,&#x201d; one of the policemen said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll soon find him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get a helicopter up,&#x201d; Tony said almost as an order.<br><br>The policeman shook his head. &#x201c;No point. Even their heat-seeking cameras can&#x2019;t see through that lot.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked past him into the trees. It was, in fact, more of a plantation than a natural wood with evergreen firs, standing cheek by jowl for as far as I could see, which wasn&#x2019;t very far at all due to a lack of illumination beneath the trees. If visible light couldn&#x2019;t penetrate the cover, it was no surprise that infrared would be unable to do so either.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you need us anymore?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Not here,&#x201d; said the senior officer. &#x201c;But you will each need to give a statement concerning this operation. Can you do that on a Section 9 form?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have one on my laptop.&#x201d;<br><br>Section 9 of the UK Criminal Justice Act 1967 allowed �written statements to be accepted by a court as evidence, provided they obeyed certain conditions. The Section 9 form wasn&#x2019;t absolutely&nbsp;essential, but it contained the necessary declarations of �truthfulness and I was happy to oblige. The police had been uncharacteristically helpful so far and I had no wish to upset them.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Tony,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201d;<br><br>Tony was my shadow, as he had been for the past two and a half weeks. His official title was Deputy Director at the Federal Anti-Corruption in Sports Agency (FACSA), based in Washington, D.C., and he was on a fact-finding mission to the UK to learn how the Integrity Department operated at the BHA.<br><br>He and I had instantly liked each other, and I had enjoyed having him around, while he, in turn, had developed a love for British steeplechasing, and especially for the Grand National.<br><br>Ten days previously, Tony and I had traveled north by train from London to Liverpool for the big race.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t get over the excitement that a single jumping race could generate in the population as a whole, with everyone discussing the relative merits of the forty runners and every workplace running its own sweepstake.<br><br>&#x201c;At home in the States, steeplechase racing is mostly a small-town affair run by farmers out in the boondocks. You&#x2019;d be lucky to have more than a couple of tents in a field somewhere with some temporary bleachers. Nothing like this.&#x201d; He had waved his hand expansively at Aintree&#x2019;s towering grandstands and the impressive media center.<br><br>&#x201c;Over seventy thousand will be here today,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said as Tony had shaken his head in disbelief, &#x201c;with tens of millions more watching live on television.&#x201d;<br><br>And the Grand National itself had certainly lived up to all the hype, with the eight-to-one favorite catching the longtime leader on the line to win by a nose in a photo finish.<br><br>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Tony had said repeatedly as the victor was loudly cheered all the way to the winner&#x2019;s circle flanked by two police horses. &#x201c;Is all your jump racing like this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, laughing. &#x201c;You should try a wet winter Wednesday at Hexham. Two men and a dog, if you&#x2019;re lucky.&#x201d;<br><br>I had gone to the National not for any specific reason but simply to watch and listen, to gather intelligence and, maybe, to defuse any trouble before it started. At least, that is what I&#x2019;d told myself, although I had mostly wanted to show off one of the great showpieces of British racing to my American guest.<br><br>He had not been disappointed.<br><br>Back in the rest area, a police van arrived with a pair of �vicious-looking German shepherds barking loudly through the rear windows.<br><br>Nigel, Tony and I stood watching as the excited, snarling dogs were removed from the vehicle by their handler, a mountain of a man with hands as large as any I had ever seen. He crouched down to cuddle each dog, in turn, allowing them to nuzzle their snouts into his neck, sharp teeth and all.<br><br>Rather him than me, I thought.<br><br>After this moment of tenderness, it was time for work.<br><br>The dogs were first taken over to the car that belonged to the fugitive and given a few moments to register his scent. Then they were off into the woods, the strain on their leads almost pulling over the handler. A smaller man would have had no chance.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;m not the one they&#x2019;re chasing,&#x201d; Nigel said. &#x201c;Did you see those bloody fangs?&#x201d;<br><br>We all laughed, but with a slight nervousness&#x2014;it was really no joking matter.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss all this excitement,&#x201d; Tony said to us with a smile as we climbed into Nigel&#x2019;s car. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m back to being stuck at my boring desk next Monday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you get out into the field at all?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Not much anymore. I&#x2019;m getting too old. And too fat.&#x201d; He guffawed loudly and clasped his hands around his substantial midriff. &#x201c;Nowadays, I have a team of young pups like you to do all my legwork.&#x201d;<br><br>He remained unusually quiet and pensive all the way back to London, a smile never leaving his face. He didn&#x2019;t elaborate on what was occupying his mind and I didn&#x2019;t press him. He would tell me if he wanted to.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t.

Considered by many of his contemporaries to be almost illiterate, he nevertheless left for publication after his death in 1895 this autobiography, which, though biased, is remarkably accurate and readable.</p> <p>Hardin was born in 1853 in Bonham, Texas, the son of a Methodist preacher. His first brush with the law came at the age of fifteen when he killed a Negro during an altercation typical of the strife-torn Reconstruction era. In the ten years between his first killing in 1868 and his final capture and imprisonment, he killed more than a score of men in personal combat and became the "most wanted" fugitive of his time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Portrait of an Artist: A Biography of Georgia O&#39;Keeffe</h2><p>Recollections of more than one hundred of O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s friends, relatives, colleagues, and neighbors as well as published and previously unpublished historical records and letters are used to provide an in-depth study of the celebrated painter&#39;s life</p><p>LAURIE LISLE is the author of <i>Without Child: Challenging the Stigma of Childlessness</i> and <i>Louise Nevelson: A Passionate Life</i>.

Lisle lives with her husband in northwestern Connecticut and Westchester County, New York.<b>Chapter One: Sun Prairie</b> <p> Late in the autumn of 1887, the <i>Sun Prairie Countryman,</i> a rural Wisconsin newspaper, briefly noted that a baby girl had arrived two days before on Tuesday, November 15, in the farmhouse of Ida and Francis O'Keeffe. The birth, assisted by a country doctor in the O'Keeffe home, was the second for the young couple. The twenty-three-year-old Ida named her infant Georgia Totto for her patrician Hungarian grandfather, George Totto. Georgia, it appeared, would have Ida's dark hair, and her round face was pure Irish, like her father's. The variegated pigment of her eyes suggested the mingled bloodlines of brown-eyed maternal forebears and blue-eyed paternal ones. </p><p> Georgia was born into a rapidly industrializing world. The country's longest suspension bridge, linking Brooklyn to Manhattan, had recently opened, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris was still under construction, due to be completed in two years. The American government in Washington, under the reformist leadership of President Grover Cleveland, was attempting to exert some control over capitalist monopolies and to bring order to the grim, oppressive factories where immigrant laborers often erupted into violence and strikes. But in the western part of the country, the last great Indian war was still to be fought against federal troops. </p><p> Little of this turmoil affected the pastoral life on the Sun Prairie farm, however. It remained like farm life everywhere, suspended in a timeless ritual governed by the rhythms of nature. The newborn baby was kept indoors during the long, dark, icy northern winter. When the snow finally melted, the sunlight became warm, and the prairie was touched by the bright green of spring, Georgia was carried outside for the first time. She was placed on a handmade patchwork quilt spread on the new grass and propped up by pillows. Those very first moments of seeing in the brilliant sunlight became indelibly etched in her memory: She precisely remembered the quilt's patterns of flowers on black and tiny red stars as well as the startling blond looks of her mother's friend. </p><p> Yet another perception during those minutes in the pool of yellow sunshine was not so pleasant. Georgia, less than a year old, was acutely aware that two other children playing on the patterned quilt were getting all the admiration. One of them was her older brother, Francis Jr., two years old, the firstborn child with dark Totto eyes, who was adorable in his mama's eyes. When he was born, weighing a plump ten and a half pounds, it had been heralded as a grand event by the <i>Countryman.</i> As Georgia crawled around the cotton quilt, she felt a sharp sting of neglect. "Why doesn't anyone think <i>I'm</i> beautiful?" she recalled wondering many years later. She squirmed off the quilt, she remembered, and was impatiently thrust back onto it. </p><p> </p><p> Georgia's was a uniquely American heritage -- three of her grandparents were immigrants, and the fourth was descended from one of the earliest colonists in the New World. Her O'Keeffe grandparents had settled in Sun Prairie first during the initial large wave of immigration to America. Pierce O'Keeffe and his wife, Catherine Mary, and other family members left for the American frontier when their family wool business in Ireland faltered. They arrived in Milwaukee through the chain of Great Lakes, then traveled directly west by oxcart for about eighty miles inland to the young settlement of Sun Prairie in the southern part of the state. In July 1848 Pierce O'Keeffe bought his first acres along the Koshkonong Creek from the federal government for less than a dollar an acre. As he turned Virgin forest into rolling farmland, his wife, Kate, gave birth to four sons: Boniface, Peter, Francis, and Bernard. </p><p> The O'Keeffes began to homestead just two months after Wisconsin ceased being a territory and entered the union as a state. Meanwhile, the last of the Winnebago Indians were being driven westward as the arriving farmers cut down the thick forests, plowed the hunting trails under, and decimated the deer. More and more land was being laid out in neatly numbered lots, and roads increasingly followed the straight lines of the surveyor's measure. At the same time, railroads were inching into the newly settled regions to transport the wheat harvests and the iron ore to other parts of the country. </p><p> About ten years after the O'Keeffes had settled in Sun Prairie in 1848, George Victor Totto and his wife bought land next to the O'Keeffe farm. Whereas the Irish family had emigrated to Wisconsin because of a business failure in the old country, George Totto had fled to America because of his belief in liberty. A count from Budapest, he had fought in a doomed Hungarian uprising against Austrian rule as an aide-de-camp to the revolutionary hero Lajos Kossuth. Family legend has it that Totto was ransomed from jail with the family jewels. In any case, he escaped to America and wound up in Sauk City, Wisconsin, later known as Prairie de Sac, where another Hungarian political refugee of a flamboyant stripe had bought land. </p><p> Totto's wife, Isabel, prided herself on her heritage as well. One of her granddaughters later uncovered many European coats of arms designed for both grandparents' families. Her roots, as deep as any in America, could be traced to a Dutchman who arrived in New York in 1637. Two hundred years later, one of his descendants, Charles Wyckoff , fathered Isabel and her younger sister Jane. Wyckoff, a hotelkeeper in the East, apparently had business troubles, and, after his wife died, he moved with his teen-age daughters and a new wife to Sauk City to try his luck at running a hotel on the frontier. Wyckoff hadn't been in Wisconsin long when a cholera epidemic broke out. Although he made plans to move his family out, a day before their departure he came down with the disease and died shortly afterwards. </p><p> It was in Sauk City that the exiled George Totto and the orphaned Isabel Wyckoff met and fell in love. In the twenty-five-year-old Isabel's eyes, the pedigreed Hungarian patriot ten years her senior was a cut above the other marriage prospects on the frontier. Formal photographs show that Totto was a thin-lipped, rather homely man with a light brown beard and that Isabel with her long, raw-boned face, could never have been called pretty. The poise and good breeding of the tall, dark-haired girl with the eastern education appealed to the European, and in May 1855 the two were married. </p><p> A year after the wedding their first child, Alletta, was born. Her birth was followed in rapid succession by those of Josephine, Charles, Ida, Leonore, and George. Meanwhile, the Tottos had moved to Sun Prairie, where the 1870 census revealed that their farm was larger and more abundant than the neighboring O'Keeffe property. But farming in the harsh midwestern climate proved too difficult for George and Isabel. In the 1870s Totto gave up and returned to Hungary, supposedly to claim his share of the family fortune. Totto may have visited his family in Wisconsin again, but he eventually died in his homeland, still worshiped, in absentia, by his daughters. Left to fend for themselves, Isabel and her six sons and daughters moved to nearby Madison in the early 1880s. The town had been a high-brow university town for more than forty years, and she must have imagined that it held better prospects for her children. </p><p> </p><p> Georgia's father, Francis Calixtus O'Keeffe, was around thirty when he began to drive his mother's buggy the twelve miles to Madison to court the fourth Totto child, Ida Ten Eyck, a poised, brown-eyed teenager. Frank had known Ida all his life as the little girl on the neighboring farm. Now Ida had grown tall like her mother and developed a more handsome version of her mother's dark looks. Frank was a wiry, good-natured farmer with fair Irish skin and curly hair. His schooling had stopped in adolescence when his father died and he had to help his mother and brothers run the farm. Then in October 1883, the brother closest in age, Peter, died of tuberculosis. It is likely that his brothers death startled Frank into the realization that his life was rapidly passing, because about this time he proposed to Ida. </p><p> Ida's family favored the match, partly because Frank wanted to buy the Totto pastures in Sun Prairie. But Ida's two older sisters weren't married, and she had little inclination to wed and return to her childhood home of Sun Prairie, a simple farm community of a few hundred people without even a library. Ida was a serious girl who kept a diary, loved books, and dreamed of becoming a doctor. It was also commonplace at the time to avoid marriage to someone with tuberculosis in the family in the mistaken belief that the highly infectious disease was hereditary. Ida, however, was young, obedient, and fond of Frank, so she reluctantly accepted his proposal. A few weeks after she turned twenty, they were married. The Sun Prairie newspaper carried the announcement: </p><p> </p><blockquote>Wedded -- At the residence of the bride's mother, in the city of Madison, on Tuesday, Feb. 19, 1884, by the Rev. J. B. Pratt, Mr. Francis O'Keeffe of Sun Prairie to Miss Ida Totto, of Madison. The contracting parties in the nuptial affair above chronicled are well and favorably known hereabouts, and the best wishes of the community are extended to Frank and his charming bride.</blockquote> <p> The Tottos considered themselves to be a notch above the O'Keeffes because of their lineage and cultivation, and the wedding was entirely a Totto affair. Although Frank was a Roman Catholic, the Tottos' Episcopal clergyman officiated. And even though either of Frank's two brothers could have signed the marriage certificate, an older brother and sister of Ida's were the witnesses. Throughout their marriage Frank would appear to be in Ida's shadow, even though he was eleven years older than she. People often echoed Ida's early doubts and wondered why a woman who carried herself like an aristocrat had married a humble Irishman. </p><p> </p><p> After the wedding, Ida had no more time to pen her thoughts in her diary. Within six months she...</p></p><h2>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</h2><p>A typically exciting Agatha Christie murder mystery</p><p></p><h2>The Loyal Lieutenant: Leading Out Lance and Pushing Through the Pain on the Rocky Road to Paris</h2><p><p>Trading on the sterling reputation that enabled him to survive a widely publicized doping confession, American cyclist &#x201c;Big George&#x201d; Hincapie&#x2014;a record seventeen-time Tour de France participant, Olympian, and key witness in the Lance Armstrong doping case&#x2014;offers an insightful account of his esteemed career and a sports era defined by performance-enhancing drug use.</p><p>In this highly anticipated cycling memoir, Big George Hincapie provides the most comprehensive account of a dark period in professional cycling, in which doping scandals have decimated the careers of some of the top athletes in the field.</p><p><em>The Loyal Lieutenant</em> reveals how Hincapie&#x2019;s life has been intrinsically tied to the sport he loves, from his earliest days in Queens, where he was influenced by his Colombian father&#x2019;s love of cycling and the Colombian &#x201c;cycling warrior&#x201d; archetype.

Recently, we bought a heavy-duty deadbolt&#x2014;we&#x2019;d never had one&#x2014;because the previous owner, who built our little house on an acre in 1971, had installed a simple push-button bedroom lock on the hollow-core front door. It wasn&#x2019;t that he was cheap; there was just no reason to have anything more secure. He didn&#x2019;t want to court karmic trouble by kitting out his home like Fort Knox. He was safe here, he told us, with his wife and two growing daughters.<br><br>When Susan and I came to look at the house on a snowy February afternoon in 2004, the owner, in his late eighties and wearing a black-and-red wool hunting coat and a green camouflage knit cap, leaned his wooden cane against one of the front pillars, pulled a massive, gas-powered snow blower out of the garage and carved a wide path for us to safely walk side by side around the property. He apologized for the state of his beloved rhododendrons and azaleas, which had recently been devoured by deer but were nonetheless neatly wrapped up like cigars from top to bottom in garden burlap as if to protect the possibility that they might flower again when the season changed; gardening is a contract with hope.<br><br>The man&#x2019;s wife, a laconic blue-eyed woman just beginning to forget, gave us a swatch of the original yellow-and-silver-striped wallpaper, in case we ever needed to match it. They had led a good life here, the man said, and were downsizing to a nearby retirement community; one daughter was moving to England and the other to a small village in the Berkshire foothills. They were proud of their home, but soft-spoken and humble in the way Yankees tend to be.<br><br>Except for removing the wallpaper, we touched nothing else for years, including the girls&#x2019; bedrooms, whose walls still bore the vinyl-flowered adhesive evidence of their childhood. We eventually turned one room into my office and the other into a book-lined guestroom that I envisioned someday containing a simple Shaker-style crib, a rocking chair, a changing table. We even took chances with the lock until I began to work from home. Susan and I had thrown caution to the wind because security and safety can be such a myth; trouble can come from anywhere.<br><br>In the years that Susan and I have been in this house, I have learned the seasonal trajectory of light, which in the morning streams through the dining room window onto our ancient barnwood table in one harsh bolt. By sundown, it glares through the living room in an explosion so bright that it&#x2019;s often hard to see the house across the street. Our life here is slow and quiet, and, for two women together nineteen years, conventional. My work is solitary; when I&#x2019;m writing, I can sit at my desk and not get up for hours, until the sun has made its circle around the house. A clock isn&#x2019;t necessary. I know what time it is by the cast of light on the walls.<br><br>On this day, the sun isn&#x2019;t all the way up, and the interior of the house is a murky gray. I have just come in from a run. I was never a runner, but I began recently because it creates a kind of porosity; it allows air and light to filter through me and loosens the knot that snares me every morning before eight when I answer the phone, in the slim moment between the ring and the sound of my mother&#x2019;s voice. A rest; a beat. A break in the symbiosis that has defined us and the universe in which we&#x2019;ve lived. I stand in my kitchen and stare at the phone. I inhale. It rings. The dog barks. I exhale. I choose my response&#x2014;the seconds between stimulus and reaction, Viktor Frankl called it&#x2014;in which lies my freedom.<br><br>Like the Centralia Mine fire, my mother and I have been burning for half a century.<br><br>We draw life from the heart of battle, a dopamine helix that propels us forward, breathing air into our days like a bellows. Some Buddhists say that anger is good when it is generative; if so, the warring to which we are addicted has enlivened us and built up our muscle memory, like the hands of a boxer. We bob and weave; we love and we loathe; we shout and whisper, and the next morning we do it all over again. Like tying our shoes or brushing our teeth or shaving one leg before the other, this is our ritual, our habit. We know no other way.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your intoxicant of choice?&#x201d; I was once asked at an AA meeting. I sat on a rusting beige metal folding chair in the basement of a white clapboard Congregational church in rural Connecticut, drinking cold coffee out of a Styrofoam cup. &#x201c;Wine? Scotch? Beer before breakfast? Shopping? Porn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My mother,&#x201d; I whispered.<br><br>People shifted; they held their chins.<br><br>My mother.<br><br>Lead a simple life, a neurologist advises Joan Didion in The White Album, when she begins in middle age to suffer from a nervous disorder with symptoms she describes as being usually associated with telethons. Not that it makes any difference we know about, the doctor adds. Leading a simple life may be nothing more than placebo, a psychogenic bandage under which one is able to catch one&#x2019;s breath and find one&#x2019;s footing. I&#x2019;d moved to the country because I&#x2019;d fallen in love with someone who lived there, but also to find the peace that I had so longed for; I fled my hometown of ten million for a village of three thousand. I was settled, but also easily startled, like a battle veteran returning to the suburbs from the front. Instead of spending my days traversing Manhattan in stony silence, my mother&#x2019;s delicate arm hooked in mine as we gazed into the shop windows along Madison Avenue, I worked in my windowed basement office that looked out onto Susan&#x2019;s shed, blanketed with the white Pierre de Ronsard climbing roses we&#x2019;d planted the summer before I left the city. We spent days together, side by side in our overgrown garden; I pulled weeds in dazed shock. My sleep began to grow fitful and my hands trembled when I drank my morning coffee. Where my mother had regularly called me four or five times every day and often waited for me to get home from work in my apartment building lobby, we now spoke only morning and night and saw each other every other week. Bitter recriminations flew. How could I have left? When was I coming back? How dare I go. While Susan slept soundly next to me in our bed two hours away from everything I&#x2019;d once known, I was jolted awake at 3:23 every morning, sweaty and disoriented, my heart pounding hard as though I&#x2019;d been grabbed by the shoulders and shaken from a night terror. I would scuttle down the stairs to the kitchen and pour myself a small juice glass of red wine, which I&#x2019;d drink while sitting on the couch in the dark next to the dog.<br><br>Wine had become a third party, a witness, a fly on my wall. The fiercer the battles with my mother, the deeper my thirst; the more wine I had, the more firmly I held my ground. My father, divorced from my mother after sixteen years of marriage, had introduced me to French Burgundies during our custodial weekends alone together. At fifteen, I furtively sipped his glasses of Gevrey-Chambertin between bites of cassoulet at fancy Manhattan restaurants, and the world was serene. With my mother, I drank either to sleep or to get drunk, to dull the blade, and the world got angry. Awakened in the middle of every night, I became an insomniac; I needed a fix. I poured myself a small glass, sat on the couch, and called her to make sure that we were okay.<br><br>It was not the alcohol to which I was addicted; it was she, and together we fed on our affection and rage like buttered popcorn. I suckled on my mother&#x2019;s beautiful fury; it fed me and nourished me. We clung to the silent compact that neither of us would ever abandon the other, no matter what.<br><br>Until I did.<br><br>I had the audacity to leave New York City for good, to find love and happiness elsewhere. To make a home and family at which she was not at the center. To leave her for another woman.<br><br>It had been a choice: my mother&#x2019;s life, or my own.</p><h2>Steps to the Sermon: An Eight-Step Plan For Preaching With Confidence (St#421238)</h2><p>In the years since the original publication of Steps To The Sermon in 1963, audiences have become more sophisticated, preachers have learned to adjust their styles to reach today&#39;s media saturated mindset, and sermon style have shifted from deductive to inductive.</p><p></p><h2>Building the Great Society: Inside Lyndon Johnson&#39;s White House</h2><p><b>The author of<i> Lincoln's Boys</i> takes us inside Lyndon Johnson's White House to show how the legendary Great Society programs were actually put into practice: <i>Team of Rivals</i> for LBJ.

But what happened after the bills passed? One man could not and did not go it alone. Joshua Zeitz reanimates the creative and contentious atmosphere inside Johnson's White House as a talented and energetic group of advisers made LBJ's vision a reality. They desegregated public and private institutions throughout one third of the United States; built Medicare and Medicaid from the ground up in one year; launched federal funding for public education; provided food support for millions of poor children and adults; and launched public television and radio, all in the space of five years, even as Vietnam strained the administration's credibility and budget.<br><br>Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, Joe Califano, Harry McPherson and the other staff members who comprised LBJ's inner circle were men as pragmatic and ambitious as Johnson, equally skilled in the art of accumulating power or throwing a sharp elbow. <i>Building the Great Society</i> is the story of how one of the most competent White House staffs in American history - serving one of the most complicated presidents ever to occupy the Oval Office - fundamentally changed everyday life for millions of citizens and forged a legacy of compassionate and interventionist government.</p><p><b>Joshua Zeitz</b> has taught American history and politics at Cambridge University, Harvard University, and Princeton University.

It was 6:15, and LBJ was only in the sixth full day of his presidency. "Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor," he began. "All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget. We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts." Reading with deliberate care from a prepared text, the president acknowledged what was surely on every American's mind: "A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose."<br><br> The day before, LBJ had delivered his first speech before a joint session of Congress-a solemn and widely acclaimed address in which the new president pledged to pick up the mantle from John F. Kennedy and secure passage of the New Frontier's sweeping but stalled policy agenda, including a major tax cut that Kennedy's advisers believed would stimulate the economy; aid to primary and secondary education; and hospital care for seniors. Dozens of LBJ's former colleagues from Dixie sat in stone-cold silence as Johnson affirmed to stirring applause that "no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law."<br><br> Now, on Thanksgiving, Johnson doubled down, asking his countrymen to join him in prayer "for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins&#x2014;for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. All of us, not just some of us, are His children."<br><br> For most Americans, Thanksgiving week marked the start of the holiday season. For Lyndon Johnson, it signaled the beginning of an intense, yearlong sprint to prove that <i>he</i> could break the logjam, achieve the New Frontier, and surpass it beyond even the wildest expectations of John Kennedy's supporters. It would be no easy lift.<br><br> "I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress," Kennedy remarked roughly a year before his death. For well over two decades, a coalition of conservative southern Democrats and northern Republicans had stymied the expansion of domestic policies first established during the New Deal era. In the Senate, an institution that the journalist William White once dubbed "the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg," conservatives made frequent use of the filibuster to prevent social welfare and civil rights legislation from coming to a vote, while in the House powerful southerners kept such measures forever bottled up in committee. Now, in a sharp rebuke to Kennedy's promise of dynamic action and national rejuvenation, the conservative coalition had all but ground the government to a halt. Not only did the House and the Senate refuse to take up key New Frontier measures. They <i>also</i> refused to pass eight of twelve routine appropriations bills, thus leaving whole parts of the government unfunded and operating on a continuing resolution that set spending at the previous year's levels.<br><br> <i>Congressional Quarterly</i> deemed the state of affairs "unprecedented," while Walter Lippmann, the dean of American journalism, bemoaned the "scandal of drift and inefficiency" that had beset Washington. "This Congress has gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and decision by delay and stultification. This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave danger to the Republic." Yet as Harry Truman famously asserted, the buck stopped with the president. A week before Kennedy's assassination, the columnist James Reston noted "a vague feeling of doubt and disappointment about President Kennedy's first term. . . . He has touched the intellect of the country, but not its heart. He has informed but not inspired the nation. He is the most popular figure, but he has been lucky in his competition. . . . [H]is problem is probably not how to get elected but how to govern."<br><br> Such was the state of affairs when Lyndon Johnson entered the White House.<br><br> LBJ first came to Washington as a young congressional staff member in the early 1930s before returning to Texas in 1935 to serve as state director of the National Youth Administration (NYA), a marquee New Deal jobs project. Two years later, and against all odds, he won a special election to Congress at age twenty-eight. An ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson established a more liberal voting record than most southern Democrats with whom he served in the House. Though he consistently opposed legislation to abolish the poll tax and to make lynching a federal crime, he joined northern Democrats in supporting expanded rights for organized labor, greater administrative oversight of business and industry, and funding for public works. Notably, he continued to do so long after most of his southern Democratic colleagues forged an informal alliance with northern Republicans to oppose the Roosevelt administration. On the strength of his New Deal credentials, FDR strongly backed Johnson in a special election to fill an unexpired Senate seat in 1941. LBJ most likely won the primary (in Texas, as throughout the South, the only vote that mattered), but party rivals stole it from him in a brazen display of election-night ballot fraud. Though in the coming years he aligned himself more closely with his state's oil and gas interests, when he ran a second time for the Senate in 1948, Johnson was once again recognized as the liberal option. After achieving a razor-thin primary victory over the conservative former governor Coke Stevenson-this time, it was likely LBJs allies who stole the election-Johnson drifted rightward during his two terms in the Senate, in part out of recognition that Texas was moving strongly in that direction and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia. Johnson delivered his maiden floor speech in opposition to civil rights, turned against former New Deal allies who now stood accused of communist loyalty, and, in his time as Democratic leader after 1953, cooperated closely with the Eisenhower administration. Many of the liberals in his caucus came to despise LBJ, particularly after he neutered their civil rights bill in 1957. They correctly perceived that he wanted to pass a weak bill in order to make his prospective presidential candidacy in 1960 palatable to northern Democrats but unobjectionable to his fellow southerners. On the day that he assumed office, very few people knew what to make of Lyndon Johnson. Was he simply a pragmatist who, deep in his heart, remained an ardent New Dealer? Or was he a southern conservative who would betray John Kennedy's unfinished legacy?<br><br> If Johnson's belief system was a matter of wide speculation, few observers doubted his keen understanding of Congress. LBJ knew that conservative Democrats, in loose cooperation with Republicans, had willfully manufactured a bottleneck of important legislation to form a bulwark against Kennedy's civil rights bill. Only when liberals capitulated and withdrew the Civil Rights Act would southern Democrats consent to bring Kennedy's tax stimulus to a vote and fund the many government initiatives-including bridges, highways, post offices, and defense projects-that their more liberal and moderate colleagues hoped to deliver to hometown constituents. Johnson knew the playbook because, as a freshman senator, he had helped to write it. As long as conservatives could hold the government hostage, much as they had in 1949, when they successfully fought back Harry Truman's civil rights agenda, they could forestall consideration of Kennedy's New Frontier agenda, including civil rights legislation that lay dying on the Hill.<br><br> It took LBJ less than a day to spring into action. In a series of phone calls before and after Thanksgiving 1963, the new president highlighted the imperative of using his political capital to clear the logjam; then, and only then, would members of Congress feel at liberty to bring civil rights and other New Frontier measures to a vote. In the meantime, however, he would keep up the pressure. On Saturday, November 30&#x2014;just over a week after assuming the presidency&#x2014;LBJ asked the former Treasury secretary Robert Anderson, a Republican and outspoken fiscal conservative, to intervene with Howard Smith, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which had broad authority to prevent legislation from proceeding to the House floor. Johnson reminded Anderson that "this country is not in any condition to take that kind of stuff . . . and that's going to hurt our people. And it's going to hurt the conservatives." Anderson agreed to speak with Smith and to convey the president's willingness to support a seldom-used measure&#x2014;a discharge petition&#x2014;to bypass Smith's committee altogether and bring the legislation directly to the full House.<br><br> Playing the other side just as artfully, Johnson placed a call to Dave McDonald, the president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and a member in good standing of the liberal coalition. "They've got to petition it out," the president instructed. "That means we got to get 219. We'll start at about 150 Democrats; that means we got to get 60, 70 Republicans." The president spoke with the passion of a true believer ("we've been talking about this for <i>100</i> years. And they won't give us a hearing on this thing, so we got to do something about it") and implored McDonald to fire up his union's formidable lobbying operation&#x2014;not only to support the discharge petition in the House, but also to move the tax and appropriations bills through committee.<br><br> Before and after the Thanksgiving holiday, Johnson repeated these conversations time and again, at once lining up support for a discharge petition in the House while affirming the need to clear the logjam of tax and spending bills <i>before</i> making a final push on civil rights in the Senate. Among those who understood the president's strategy was Senator George Smathers, a conservative Democrat from Florida who ultimately opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but who represented a faction of the southern caucus that was disinclined to grind all government to a halt indefinitely over civil rights. The "sooner we can get a civil rights bill over with," he told Johnson, "get that part of it ended and out of the way, the better off the South's going to be, and the better off the North's going to be, and the better off everybody's going to be. And they wouldn't hide behind the tax bill&#x2014;and hide behind a lot of other bills, just on the pretense of being against them when the real fact is they're against the civil rights bill."<br><br> Without prompting&#x2014;and without the knowledge that LBJ had been making a similar case to his economic advisers for several days&#x2014;Smathers suggested that the president make a concerted effort to woo Harry F. Byrd, the deeply conservative chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. If Johnson were willing to indulge Byrd's obsession with fiscal discipline and bring the 1964-1965 federal budget under $100 billion, then the chairman <i>might</i> allow the tax cut to clear through his committee. "Wish you'd feel Byrd out," LBJ agreed, "and give me a pretty good, full report." Unknowingly, George Smathers would help set in motion a chain of events whose consequences would be far reaching.<br><br> The strategy that Lyndon Johnson developed in the first week of his presidency had a profound but highly calculated effect. The pressure that his supporters placed on Howard Smith&#x2014;and the chairman's realization that a discharge petition, if successful, would permanently undermine his authority&#x2014;persuaded the cantankerous Virginian to allow the Civil Rights Act to reach the House floor. Beginning with outreach from Smathers, LBJ simultaneously courted Harry Byrd until the patrician senator effectively agreed to swap budget cuts for a tax stimulus. With major economic legislation now cleared through Congress, the president had paved the way for passage of long-awaited civil rights legislation.<br><br> Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, some of Johnson's advisers cautioned him that presidents should not spend valuable capital on hopeless causes. "Well," he purportedly replied, "what the hell's the presidency for?"<br><br> LBJ ultimately brought his budget under $100 billion, pushed Kennedy's tax cut through Congress, and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act-all by late June 1964. He accomplished these measures while also declaring an "unconditional war on poverty" and creating the blueprint for the Great Society&#x2014;the most ambitious domestic agenda since the New Deal. Though LBJ's early success owed in part to his mastery of legislative strategy, equally fundamental were efforts by advocacy groups-religious and lay alike-on behalf of civil rights and social justice legislation. Above all, Johnson benefited from a deep well of public support in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. The president's approval ratings, which fluctuated between 70 percent and 77 percent throughout the spring, owed at least as much to the country's determination to lock arms with its new leader as to LBJ's policy and political triumphs.<br><br> Unlike most of his predecessors, LBJ did not enjoy the benefit of a transition period to build the team that would help him, in turn, build his vision. Instead, he had little choice but to improvise on the spot&#x2014;to pull a trusted friend like Jack Valenti along with him to the White House or entreat old hands from his House and Senate days to join him on a new and unfamiliar journey. These handicaps notwithstanding, in that first year of seemingly unrestrained activity and accomplishment&#x2014;from the time of Kennedy's death to his own election to the presidency in late 1964&#x2014;Johnson assembled an ad hoc staff that defied the expectations of even the most cynical Washington hands. They were a "coalition government" of Kennedy and Johnson men&#x2014;a "strange amalgam of Austin and Boston, of cool, brainy Easterners and shrewd, folksy Texans, of men who had always been fiercely loyal to him and men who had fought and belittled him before the 1960 Los Angeles Democratic convention," according to Charles Roberts, who covered the White House for <i>Newsweek</i>. "It is some kind of tribute to Isaiah and the LBJ Way that the transition went as smoothly as it did."</p><h2>Mother Wonderful&#39;s Cheesecakes and Other Goodies: With 20 Absolutely New No-Bake Cheesecakes</h2><p>Recipes for thirty varieties of Christmas cookies are combined with recipes for basic as well as unusual cakes and more than fifty different kinds of cheesecakes</p><p></p><h2>Murder, My Suite (Bed-and-Breakfast Mysteries)</h2><p>Hoping to recover from a visit by a gossip columnist, Hillside Manor hostess Judith McMonigle Flynn visits her cousin at a ski resort only to learn that the same columnist is scheduled to arrive there--unless a killer gets in the way.

The stick, long and thin, was made of plastic. It hadn&#x2019;t hurt much the first time it touched my skin. But that was over an hour and a hundred flails ago. Now every swat felt like I was being smacked by a baseball bat. <br>A bat spiked with 20-penny nails. <br>&#x201c;You will confess!&#x201d; shouted my tormentor. &#x201c;You will fall on your knees before the one true God, blessed be His holy name.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Screw yourself,&#x201d; I said between my gritted teeth. <br> <i>Thwack.</i> <br>&#x201c;Ugh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Confess! Or we will beat salvation into you!&#x201d; <br>I was seeing a part of Saudi Arabia that the Tourist Board doesn&#x2019;t advertise. You can call it the belly of the beast; to my mind, it&#x2019;s a much lower part of the anatomy. <br>&#x201c;Do you confess?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; <br> <i>Thwack. Thwack.</i> <br>Under intense international pressure a few years back, the Saudi government reformed its prison system. The new rules give certain guidelines for &#x201c;corrective measures&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, beating the crap out of a prisoner. The &#x201c;corrector&#x201d; must hold a book under his arm while administering lashes. The idea was to keep the torturer from raising the cane too high over his head. <br>I can attest that the letter of the law was observed in this case. I even know the title of the book, which was an illustrated comic collection entitled <i>Brave Men in Saudi History.</i> The book, four pages long (two of them were blank), was duct-taped to his underarm. <br> <i>Thwack. Thaaaaa-WACK!</i> <br>Somewhere around whack number sixty-eight, I had begun fantasizing about what I would do to the bastard with the stick. My thoughts were very creative, and in no case would the stick have been recognizable as a stick when I was done. <br>By now, though, I was beyond any sort of fantasy. I was, as the football play-by-play analysts put it, grinding it out. I just hoped the end of the game wasn&#x2019;t going to be signaled by a gun. <br>The Apaches, among other Native American tribes, have an especially useful mechanism for dealing with intense pain. I adopted it now, focusing my concentration on a point just outside my body. As the beatings continued, my mind stepped away and observed the scene. <br>This got me through another thirty or forty lashes. Finally the pain overwhelmed my body and I blacked out. Oblivion was a welcome reprieve, but it didn&#x2019;t last long. I came to only a few minutes later, as I was being dragged along a dank and dark cement corridor. <br>I have no idea why the corridor was dank&#x2014;the prison I was in was located at the edge of the Saudi desert, which has to be one of the driest places on earth. But dank it was. Moss, crud, and slime water blended into a horrendously smelling m�lange between the inlaid stones of the floor. I tried not to breathe. <br>I&#x2019;m far from a connoisseur, but I think I can say with some authority that Saudi jails are among the worst in the world. It doesn&#x2019;t even take that much to get into them. The surest way is by opposing the government or insulting the royal family, but you can get there with much lesser offenses if you know what you&#x2019;re doing. Drink a beer in your yard or drive a car with a woman who&#x2019;s not your wife&#x2014;supposed outrages to Islam&#x2014;and you will land there in a flash, even if you&#x2019;re a foreigner. Even random victims of crime who had the audacity to file police reports have found themselves guests of the state. <br>They were lying, you see. Because the Kingdom is PERFECT, and thus there is no crime, and anyone who says different is a slanderer who deserves to lose his tongue. <br>Being a traditionalist, I had chosen an oldie but a goldie to ensure my incarceration: I had insulted the Prophet and the Kingdom by proselytizing a vermin religion. <br>Said religion being Coptic Hinduism, which I had invented solely for the purpose of running afoul of the authorities. <br>Not that Coptic Hinduism preaches violence or anything remotely touching on the state or other religions. It borrows freely from all pantheons and pathways, seeking peaceful coexistence with all. We&#x2019;re not much on sacraments, and the heavy burden of conversion is best left to those of other beliefs. In fact, the most definite (and important) thing you can say about it, at least in the context of Saudi Arabia, is that it is not Islam, and therefore fit for repression. <br>The two guards dragging me to my cell were kindly fellows, and they tried cheering me up along the way by shouting various slogans in Arabic. <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a blessed fellow!&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be very popular in jail!&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Now you will have a real chance to pray.&#x201d;</i> <br>My Arabic is mostly of use in brothels and street fights, so maybe my translation is a little soft. I will say that the others in my cell, all twelve of them, welcomed me with open arms and hard feet as I was hurled into the tiny space. <br>Walled by solid concrete on three sides, the room was roughly eight by six feet and smelled of sweat and human excrement. I curled myself into a corner at the back, hoping to be left alone. <br>Unfortunately, one of my fellow inmates had deputized himself as the Welcome Wagon. As he bent over me, a shiv appeared in his hand and he took a swipe at my face. <br>Coptic Hinduism has very strong precepts against having your face cut up and eyeballs gouged out. It has been heavily influenced by what many readers will recall as the Rogue Warrior&#x2019;s First Commandment: <br> <i>Do unto others before they do unto you.</i> <br>I decided that this was a good time to do some preaching. My opening text was a fist to the nether regions of my new congregant. This was followed by a fist to the throat. <br>The convict was impressed. He had never before encountered the spiritual depth of Coptic Hinduism. <br>Still, he was firm in his own primitive convictions, and pressed forward in his attempt to make a blood sacrifice to his gods. While I wanted nothing to do with such primitive religious practices, my retreat was cut off by the thick and immovable wall behind me. <br>He cut a halo across my forehead. I decided to return the favor by encouraging him to kneel and reflect on the holy light of the universe. Given that he was clearly devout, all he needed was a little push. <br>Or shove. <br>I sent him sprawling against the nearby wall. The others were looking on anxiously, perhaps hoping for their chance at conversion as well. So I leapt up, grabbed the little knife that had fallen from my convert&#x2019;s hand, and baptized him in the name of the Rogue, the Warrior, and the decidedly Unfriendly Ghost. <br>Duly impressed, the others backed away. <br>Exhausted by my spiritual experience, I dragged myself to the corner of the cell. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>You may very well be wondering what I was doing in Saudi Arabia in the first place. <br>The truth was I was here to find another American, Garrett Taylor. Garrett was the son of a friend of mine; he&#x2019;d gotten into a bit of trouble in the Kingdom Oil Built a few days before. I&#x2019;d heard that he was currently a guest at this esteemed Saudi institution. I had therefore posed rather ostentatiously as a preacher in hopes of meeting him. <br>Be careful what you wish for. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Not long after the blood stopped flowing from the neck of my new convert, a series of loud shouts announced the approach of the guards. We were ordered to clear the cell. I got up, hiding my shiv in the waistband of my pants. My knees were creaking and my spine felt as if it had been removed from my body and rearranged in a random pattern. Being last made me a target for the guards, who proceeded to give me a series of gentle love taps as a reward. <br>I thought they were coming to investigate the ruckus, but they made no move to do so beyond kicking over the limp body of my follower. I kept my head low and eyes peeled as I stumbled down the hall. When we came to the end of the corridor, we took a turn right and made our way up a set of concrete steps. Two guards behind me very kindly assisted my progress with a few kicks; otherwise I was left alone. <br>We were led to the courtyard behind the building. Stumbling, I took my place at the end of a line of prisoners who were kneeling in the direction of Mecca. I&#x2019;m not very big on praying, especially to Allah; a guard watching the line helped me into position with a punch between my shoulder blades; I put my head down and caught my breath as a loudspeaker began barking the call to prayers. <br>A few phrases into the proceeding, I recovered enough to raise my head slightly and look around for Garrett. There were maybe a hundred inmates in our little corner of paradise; none looked even remotely like the man I&#x2019;d come to rescue. <br>Prayers over, the inmates were allowed to walk for a few minutes before being led to dinner. I mingled silently. The courtyard was about twenty by fifty feet&#x2014;spacious for a Saudi jail&#x2014;and bounded by a high chain-link fence topped by barbed wire. There was another fence a short distance away, with another courtyard on the other side of that. <br>I circled around, mumbling to myself in a combination of random street Arabic and the occasional French and English. Anyone who heard me would think I was deranged&#x2014;all in all, not a bad assumption, actually. <br>He didn&#x2019;t seem to be in our courtyard. I sidled next to the fence and slid down to my haunches. <br>&#x201c;Garrett?&#x201d; I asked, raising my voice loud enough to be heard in the neighboring yard. None of the men close to the fence looked anything like him. <br>&#x201c;Garrett?&#x201d; <br>Some of my cellmates had gathered nearby and started talking loudly. I couldn&#x2019;t make out what they were saying, but the glances they threw me convinced me I better pay some attention to them. I was just about to when someone pressed against the fence behind me. <br>&#x201c;You? What are you doing here?&#x201d; said a voice in perfectly enunciated English. <br>I turned and looked through the fence. A young man who looked remarkably like my old shipmate was staring through the chain links. His face was battered&#x2014;eyes bloodshot, cheeks checkered with cuts, his left temple the color of an eggplant at harvesttime. <br>&#x201c;Garrett Taylor?&#x201d; I whispered, though I was sure I had found my man. <br>&#x201c;Marcinko?&#x201d; He shifted a bit, trying to get a better view. &#x201c;Demo Dick? Here? Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I came to get you out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; <br>He sounded a little more skeptical than I would have liked. Admittedly, his location in the other building presented a problem, but that was only temporary. <br>&#x201c;You could sound a little more enthusiastic,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll see how enthusiastic you are after you get the crap knocked out of you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s already happened,&#x201d; I told him. <br>&#x201c;I meant from them,&#x201d; he said, pointing. <br>I turned back around. Three of my cellmates were stalking across the small courtyard in my direction. They didn&#x2019;t look like they were in the mood for prayers. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>But before I get pummeled, let&#x2019;s go back to the beginning of this twisted tale.

This one may be the most interesting find of all: published in 1961, before the Cuban Missile Crisis and only&nbsp;a few&nbsp;years after Castro assumed control of the government, the novel anticipates the various off-the-wall attempts by the U.S. to assassinate the Cuban leader. Five Americans, some hardened criminals, others idealists with various anti-Castro axes to grind, are offered $20,000 each if any of them succeed in killing the dictator. Three separate plots unwind simultaneously, as Block tracks the reactions of his five principals as they, variously, realize the improbability of their task, stick to their idealistic guns, or come under the sway of the Cuban nationals they encounter. The ending may seem far-fetched in light of later history, but as a kind of alternate pulp history, the novel works just fine, with plenty of blood and bullets and, as always with Block, a fine feel for character. A curiosity, yes, but also an entertaining thriller. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us</h2><p>A psychologist confronts the topic of psychopathy, presenting it as a dark mystery with staggering implications for society and showing readers how to recognize whether their bosses, lovers, or friends are psychopaths</p><p>"Psychopaths are social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of broken hearts, shattered expectations, and empty wallets. Completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others, they selfishly take what they want and do as they please..." In <i>Without Conscience</i> Robert Hare argues convincingly that "psychopath" and "antisocial personality disorder" (a psychiatric term defined by a cluster of criminal behaviors) are not the same thing. Not all psychopaths are criminals, he says, and not all criminals are psychopaths. He proposes a psychopathy checklist that includes emotional/interpersonal traits such as glibness, grandiosity, lack of guilt, and shallow emotions, as well as social deviance traits such as impulsiveness, lack of responsibility, and antisocial behavior. His writing is lucid and illustrated with numerous anecdotes. The final chapter, "A Survival Guide," is especially recommended: as Hare writes, "Psychopaths are found in every segment of society, and there is a good chance that eventually you will have a painful or humiliating encounter with one."A brilliant, in-depth handling of a most complex subject (Hugh Aynesworth, author of Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer).</p><h2>August 1914,</h2><p>Part of a sequence of novels about the Russian Revolution carrying the overall title of &#34;The Red Wheel&#34;.

Hersh, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>&#x201c;Robert Baer [was] one of the most talented Middle East case officers of the past twenty years.&#x201d; &#x2014;Reuel Marc Gerecht, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>In<b> See No Evil</b>, one of the CIA&#x2019;s top field officers of the past quarter century recounts his career running agents in the back alleys of the Middle East. In the process, Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides compelling evidence about how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA&#x2019;s efforts to root out the world&#x2019;s deadliest terrorists.<br>On the morning of September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the terrible result of that intelligence failure with the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the wake of those attacks, Americans were left wondering how such an obviously long-term, globally coordinated plot could have escaped detection by the CIA and taken the nation by surprise. Robert Baer was not surprised. A twenty-one-year veteran of the CIA&#x2019;s Directorate of Operations who had left the agency in 1997, Baer observed firsthand how an increasingly bureaucratic CIA lost its way in the post&#x2013;cold war world and refused to adequately acknowledge and neutralize the growing threat of Islamic fundamentalist terror in the Middle East and elsewhere.<br><br>A throwback to the days when CIA operatives got results by getting their hands dirty and running covert operations, Baer spent his career chasing down leads on suspected terrorists in the world&#x2019;s most volatile hot spots. As he and his agents risked their lives gathering intelligence, he watched as the CIA reduced drastically its operations overseas, failed to put in place people who knew local languages and customs, and rewarded workers who knew how to play the political games of the agency&#x2019;s suburban Washington headquarters but not how to recruit agents on the ground.<br><br><b>See No Evil</b> is not only a candid memoir of the education and disillusionment of an intelligence operative but also an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism. Baer reveals some of the disturbing details he uncovered in his work, including:<br><br>* In 1996, Osama bin Laden established a strategic alliance with Iran to coordinate terrorist attacks against the United States.<br><br>* In 1995, the National Security Council intentionally aborted a military coup d&#x2019;etat against Saddam Hussein, forgoing the last opportunity to get rid of him. <br><br>* In 1991, the CIA intentionally shut down its operations in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and ignored fundamentalists operating there.<br><br>When Baer left the agency in 1997 he received the Career Intelligence Medal, with a citation that says, &#x201c;He repeatedly put himself in personal danger, working the hardest targets, in service to his country.&#x201d; <b>See No Evil</b> is Baer&#x2019;s frank assessment of an agency that forgot that &#x201c;service to country&#x201d; must transcend politics and is a forceful plea for the CIA to return to its original mission&#x2014;the preservation of our national sovereignty and the American way of life.<br><b>From The Preface</b><br>This book is a memoir of one foot soldier&#x2019;s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It&#x2019;s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don&#x2019;t need to do business with.<br><br>This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.<br><br>The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.</p><p>&#x201c;See No Evil is a compelling account of America&#x2019;s failed efforts to &#x2018;listen in&#x2019; on the rest of the world, especially the parts of it that intend to do us harm.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <br>officer in the Middle East.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Seymour M.

You can visit Sheila on Twitter and Facebook or at her website (http://www.sheilasplace.com).The party was going perfectly until the hostess clutched her stomach with an agonized cry and crumpled to the floor.<br><br>Rory Rourke, her boyfriend and star of the new TV series <em>Man Handled,</em> knelt by the woman's side and barked, "Someone, call 911."<br><br>"Call her doctor," said someone else.<br><br>"Call the <em>Star Reporter"</em> the victim said faintly.<br><br>And that was when Bailey Sterling knew she was in trouble.<br><br>She'd been so excited to land this gig catering Samba Barrett's party. Samba wasn't an Emma Stone or Kristen Stewart, but she was...someone. Sort of. And with her catlike green eyes and red hair, she was on her way up, like the rest of her party guests. It was what everyone said. And surely that had meant Bailey was on her way up, too. The West Hollywood apartment had been packed with hot young actors and actresses. As she'd slipped among them bearing trays of goodies, she'd heard more than one person rave about the food and had envisioned a whole string of catering gigs after this one.<br><br>The shrimp salsa in phyllo cups had been an especially big hit. "Oh, my God, this is to die for," Angelica Winston (from the new reality show <em>Hard Ass)</em> had raved. Bailey had smiled modestly and kept circulating, while her assistant Giorgio served up stuffed mushrooms. She'd been working for the past three years to earn a reputation as caterer to the stars, and things were finally starting to happen.<br><br>Except here was Samba Barrett, writhing on her living room floor, groaning in agony. Twenty minutes ago she'd been eating those shrimp cups and laughing. Did she have food allergies she hadn't told Bailey about? Samba had gone over the menu with her, approved everything. How could this have <em>happened?</em> Was Bailey going to be known as killer of the stars?<br><br>Thirty people gathered around the actress, some offering advice, some taking pictures with their cell phones, others texting wildly. Bailey stood on the fringe and nervously downed one of her own appetizers.<br><br>"You'll be okay, baby," Rory Rourke assured Samba.<br><br>"I think I ate something bad," she whimpered.<br><br>"Oh, no, that's not possible," Bailey protested, and everyone turned to look at her. One woman aimed her cell phone at Bailey, capturing her miserable expression. This <em>couldn't</em> be happening.<br><br>But it could. And it was. Now Bailey felt sick. She lost her grip on the tray of canap�s she was carrying and down they went, the tray landing on the Jimmy Choos of one of the party guests busily recording her hostess's misery on her cell phone.<br><br>The woman next to her let out a yelp and jumped back, then glared at Bailey.<br><br>"Sorry," Bailey muttered and bent to scoop the mess onto the tray. In the process she managed to get in the way of another guest, nearly tripping him.<br><br>He didn't settle for glaring. He swore at her.<br><br>Catering hell&#x2014;that was what this was. Bailey made a dash for the kitchen and hid out, watching the drama unfold from behind the counter.<br><br>The ambulance arrived, and the EMTs showed up to take Samba's vitals and load her onto a stretcher. Then away she went, a pitiful&#x2014;but gorgeous&#x2014;victim of Sterling Catering.<br><br>The guests switched from eating to drinking. Rory told Bailey she could clean up and leave, and not in the kindest tone of voice. He didn't offer to pay her, and she didn't ask. All she wanted to do was get out of that cramped apartment full of the young and the beautiful.<br><br>By the time she left, the media was waiting. Photographers snapped her picture, and reporters stuck microphones in her face. "Have you catered for Samba before?"... "Has Samba threatened to sue?"... "What's your relationship with Rory Rourke?"<br><br>Bailey stood there like Bambi staring at the headlights of a Mack truck, her toque askew, offering quotable quotes such as, "What?"<br><br>She quickly realized that it was time to scram and bolted for the van where Giorgio was loading up boxes of supplies...and telling a reporter that he wasn't involved with any of the food prep. "I'm only doing this while I wait to hear from my agent. We've got something big in the works. Giorgio Romano. R-o-m..."<br><br>Bailey tossed in the last of her serving equipment, then tugged on his double-breasted white jacket and growled, "Get in the van," even as the vultures who'd been talking to him now turned their attention to her.<br><br>He scowled at her but got moving.<br><br>They drove away with photographers pointing their cameras and shooting. "What were you thinking?" she demanded, swerving to avoid one.<br><br>"I wasn't thinking anything. I was just answering questions."<br><br>"Well, thanks a lot," she snapped.<br><br>He held out both hands. "What did you want me to do?"<br><br>"How about saying that Sterling Catering was not responsible for Samba Barrett's illness?" she suggested, her voice rising.<br><br>"I can't be sure of that," Giorgio said sullenly.<br><br>"You've been working for me for six months now, Giorgio. You know how good I am. You could have said something." Was there no loyalty in the world? She brushed away a tear.<br><br>"I told you, I'm only here until I get my break."<br><br>"And I suppose that was it," she said in disgust. "Getting your name in the paper as a caterer?"<br><br>"Every little bit helps," he retorted. "Publicity is great, even if it's bad."<br><br>Not for a caterer. She had a small liability policy, but it didn't cover bad press. Overwhelmed with misery, Bailey pulled off the road and began to cry in earnest.<br><br>Giorgio sat there in what she thought was silent sympathy. Until he said, "Here, let me drive. I've got a date."<br><br>She raised her tearstained face from the steering wheel. "A date? You were working the party."<br><br>"Yeah. But when it ended early..." He shrugged. "Sorry."<br><br><em>Sorry</em> about summed it up.<br><br>After a long day of work punctuated hourly by texts from her miserable little sister, Cecily Sterling was standing in line at the Icicle Falls Safeway with her recharge essentials&#x2014;a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream and a bag of Cheetos. It seemed everyone else in Icicle Falls had had a long day at work, too, and the store was packed.<br><br>She'd already run into Dot Morrison, who'd eyed her purchases and said, "Now, that's my kind of dinner."<br><br>She'd planned on adding more to her "dinner," but she'd spotted Luke Goodman, the production manager at her family's chocolate company, in the cookie department with his daughter, Serena, and had decided to skip the cookies.<br><br>Not that she didn't want to see little Serena or, as Serena would insist, Big Serena now that she'd "graduated" from kindergarten. Serena's visits to the Sweet Dreams Chocolates office with her grandma gave Cecily her kid fix on a regular basis.<br><br>But Serena's daddy was another matter.<br><br>Luke Goodman was a nice guy. He had the husky build of a wrestler (which he'd been in high school), kind blue eyes and a great smile. He was a widower, and he'd been interested in Cecily ever since she'd moved back home to Icicle Falls. The only problem was that she wasn't interested in him as anything more than a friend.<br><br>She should have been. What was wrong with her, anyway? She had such a gift for matching up other people. She'd brought together friends in high school and in college; thanks to her, a lot of weddings had taken place. She'd even been in the matchmaking business, for crying out loud. She could size people up and instinctively know who should be with whom. But when it came to herself she knew nothing. She'd been engaged twice, and each man had turned out to be a loser and a user. Pathetic.<br><br>Luke was neither of those, and he wanted her. So why did her stupid hormones do the happy dance every time she got anywhere near Todd Black?<br><br>Todd had also been after her ever since she'd moved home. He owned The Man Cave, a seedy tavern at the edge of town, and he was no Luke Goodman. He looked like Johnny Depp's kid brother, and he was a heartbreak waiting to happen. He had bad boy written all over him, from the double entendre s he was so good at throwing Cecily's way to how he looked at her, as if she were a chocolate bar he'd like to unwrap. Slowly. Luke Goodman was the kind of man who married a girl, but Todd Black was the kind who slept with her and then conveniently forgot to call the next day.<br><br>She should have no interest whatsoever in Todd Black. And she certainly should never have agreed to stop by his tavern on Friday night to play pinball when she'd run into him earlier that day at Bavarian Brews.<br><br>But he'd caught her in a weak moment. She'd been worried about her younger sister, Bailey, and she'd said yes without thinking. At least that was her excuse. She really couldn't blame her moment of weakness on preoccupation, though. Insanity was the true culprit. Anytime she was around that man he heated up her hormones and fried her brain. Now she was going to go home and rewire the synapses with junk food and a long bubble bath. She enjoyed making bath salts and bubble bath and could hardly wait to indulge in her latest creation&#x2014;lavender-vanilla.<br><br>She'd barely gotten in line when Cass Wilkes walked up behind her and said hi. "Ice cream&#x2014;food of the gods."<br><br>Cass was Cecily's sister Samantha's BFF, but she'd opened the door of friendship to Cecily, too, and they saw each other every Sunday at Cass's chick-flick nights and during their monthly book-club meetings.<br><br>Cecily smiled, feeling slightly embarrassed. That was both the beauty and the curse of living in a small town. Everyone knew your business. "Not exactly the diet special, is it?"<br><br>"No, but I can't exactly say anything." Cass held up her shopping basket, which contained a pizza and a two-liter bottle of root beer. "You can see we're eating well tonight."<br><br>The basket also held a bag of ready-made salad. "It's not all bad," Cecily said, pointing to the salad. "And pizza has good things on it."<br><br>"That's what I keep telling myself. I also keep telling myself that I'm only going to eat the salad and leave the pizza for the kids. But I'm lying."<br><br>"Life's too short not to eat pizza," Cecily said with a smile. The smile fell away when her cell phone started singing Bailey's ringtone, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun."<br><br>Bailey's life had been anything but fun the past couple of days. She had called Cecily the evening of the disastrous party, practically hysterical. They'd pulled in Samantha, who had found Bailey a tough L.A. lawyer, but no legal shark could save her from bad publicity. Of course, the story had made the papers, and all the TV stations had repeatedly run the footage of her van driving away, leaving the scene of the "crime." Naturally, they'd zoomed in on Sterling Catering painted on the side of the van. Word of mouth had added to the avalanche of bad press. People who'd booked her for their events had been calling right and left and canceling.<br><br>Cecily answered, bracing herself for more bad news.<br><br>Sure enough. "Have you seen the <em>Star Reporter?"</em><br><br>Oh, no. What now? Cecily turned to the magazine rack near the cash register. There, on the front of the latest popular celebrity news rag, was a picture of Bailey in her white caterer's coat, standing outside Samba Barrett's apartment building. She was wearing an expression of shock, along with her chef's toque, her big hazel eyes wide and her mouth dangling open. She looked more confused than crazy. In fact, she looked like the village idiot. The bold print above the picture proclaimed, Samba Barrett Poisoned? Crazy Caterer Tries to Take Out the Competition.<br><br>"Oh, no." Cecily dropped her junk food on the checkout conveyor belt and grabbed the magazine.<br><br>Cass, standing right next to her, took one, too, muttering, "Those creeps."<br><br>"This is the worst yet. I'm ruined!" Bailey wailed.<br><br>"That headline doesn't make sense. What competition are they talking about?" Cecily asked, trying to balance her cell phone, calm her sister and turn to the article all at the same time.<br><br>"They're saying I had a thing for Rory Rourke, which is ridiculous. I don't even know Rory Rourke. I didn't know any of those people!"<br><br>During the past forty-eight hours, Bailey's moods had swung between grim resignation and wild hysteria. It wasn't hard to tell what mode she was in now. "This is a gossip rag," Cecily reminded her. "You can't believe what you read in papers like this. Nobody takes this stuff seriously."<br><br>"My business is trashed. My life is trashed. I don't even have money to pay for the lawyer."<br><br>"Samantha and I told you not to worry about that," Cecily told her. "It's being taken care of." News had traveled as fast around Icicle Falls as it had in L.A., and Dot Morrison and Pat Wilder, two of the town's older businesswomen, had already set up a special bank account for Bailey's defense fund.<br><br>Not that she was going to need it. Anyone with eyes could see the actress had pulled a cheap publicity stunt. The lawyer was on top of things, and Cecily was sure that before the month was over, Bailey would be out from under this. She said as much, hoping to calm her sister.<br><br>"It's just...this article," Bailey said between sobs. "I'm nothing like that. And I worked so hard to build my business. Now it's...gone."<br><br>Cecily wished she could reassure her, but in Hollywood, where making an impression was everything, well, it didn't look good for Sterling Catering. "Come home," she said.<br><br>"I can't."<br><br>Cecily knew how hard it was to give up a dream. She also knew how hard it was to come full circle, right back to where you started. She'd done it herself. It had turned out to be exactly what she needed, and she was much happier working in the family business than she'd been trying to match up gold diggers with shallow men who wanted Playboy bunnies.<br><br>"Think about it," she urged. "Everyone here loves you."<br><br>"That's for sure," Cass said over her shoulder.<br><br>"I can't even leave my apartment. There are reporters hiding in the bushes."<br><br>"They won't hide there forever. And I can guarantee they won't follow you here," Cecily said. At least she hoped they wouldn't. "The story will die down as soon as the next manufactured scandal hits. Which, I predict, will be sometime within the next seventy-two hours."<br><br>"I asked her if she had any allergies," Bailey said. "I have all kinds of menus to choose from, and she chose that one."<br><br>"Don't worry. This will all work out," Cecily promised.<br><br>It was as if Bailey hadn't heard. "I'm ruined," she said again.<br><br>"Only temporarily."<br><br>"Well, how long is temporary?" Bailey cried. That was something for which Cecily had no answer.<br><br>Ruined, Bailey thought miserably as she ended the call with her sister. She'd gone to the hospital to see Samba, thinking maybe they could talk, that she could explain why her food couldn't possibly have made the actress sick. She'd even brought flowers. She'd encountered a hired guard at the door of Samba's private room, and all he'd allowed in had been the flowers, along with the get-well card on which Bailey had written, <em>I hope you feel better soon.</em> But now she hoped Samba contracted terminal acne.<br><br>Well, okay, not really. She liked to think she was better than that.&lt;...</p><h2>Tiger Prince</h2><p>During a much-needed vacation in Jamaica to escape memories of a painful divorce and her high-pressure job, Caren Blakemore meets the man of her dreams, but she soon discovers that her love affair with Derek Allen, the notorious Tiger Prince, has become the focus of every tabloid in America.

Originally published in 1929 and revised in 1931, Indian Wars is based primarily on the Pennsylvania Archives and Colonial Records. With background chapters on Indian religion, character and the Indian tribes of Pennsylvania, Sipe discusses chapter by chapter the 40 years of Indian Wars from 1755 to 1795. Beginning with the French &amp;Indian War and the causes that led up to it, Sipe covers all Indian uprisings and tragedies, Pontiac s War, Lord Dunmore s War, and concludes with 7 chapters on the Indian influence on the Revolutionary War. With Pennsylvania as keystone of the colonies and gateway to the west, it is indeed appropriate that Sipe called the Indian Wars of the Eastern Frontier the Indian Wars of Pennsylvania. All of the major wars of this time period (1755-1795) had their roots in Pennsylvania history and most military leaders involved in those Indian Wars and a majority of their fighting men were from Pennsylvania. The real key to this work is the 156 page supplement that includes: A chronological listing of all major Indian events on the Eastern Frontier; details of Sullivan s campaign against the Indians; and the most detailed set of footnotes and references ever seen. Mr. Sipe s personal copy was used to reproduce this book, complete with his handwritten corrections in the margins of several pages.

Warne &amp;Co publisher, Very Good hardback with jacket, illustrations by Beatrix Potter. no publication date</p><p>The quintessential cautionary tale, <i>Peter Rabbit</i> warns naughty children about the grave consequences of misbehaving. When Mrs. Rabbit beseeches her four furry children not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, the impish Peter naturally takes this as an open invitation to create mischief. He quickly gets in over his head, when he is spotted by farmer McGregor himself. Any child with a spark of sass will find Peter's adventures remarkably familiar. And they'll see in Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail that bane of their existence: the "good" sibling who always does the right thing. One earns bread and milk and blackberries for supper, while the obstinate folly of the other warrants medicine and an early bedtime. <p> Beatrix Potter's animal stories have been a joy to generations of young readers. Her warm, playful illustrations in soft colors invite children into the world of words and flights of fancy. Once there, she gently and humorously guides readers along the path of righteousness, leaving just enough room for children to wonder if that incorrigible Peter will be back in McGregor's garden tomorrow. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschool)</i></p>Mr. McGregor has two things on his mind when he sees Peter in his garden. One is the safety of his lettuces; the other is rabbit pie. Peter was carefully told not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, but some little bunnies have to learn things the hard way. Beatrix Potter's classic story has been lovingly placed at the center of this creative effort, and David Jorgensen has given Peter and his family wonderfully droll and expressive character and charm in his illustrations. On the accompanying audiocaasette, Meryl Streep explores all of the drame, humor, and subtlety of the narrative, and none of its potential to entertain and teach has been left untapped. Musician/composer Lyle Mays has coordinated and augmented the work of both illustrator and narrator with a score that unifies and enlivens the whole enterprise. The combined artistry of the contributors results in a new and enriching experience that will be loved by all. <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> was awarded a Grammy nomination for best recording for children in 1988.</p><h2>Lakota of the Rosebud: A Contemporary Ethnography (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology)</h2><p>This tribe of South Dakota has met the challenge of living in the 20th century by expressing religion and beliefs in a cultural style that mixes tradition and Christian influence with western technology.</p><p></p><h2>Freedom of Simplicity</h2><p>Written in the same warm, accessible style as Richard Foster's best-selling <i>Celebration of Discipline, Freedom of Simplicity</i> articulates a creative, more human style of living and points the way for Christians to make their lives "models of simplicity."

While still young he composed his extant epic poem of four books on the story of the Argonauts. When this work failed to win acceptance he went to Rhodes where he not only did well as a rhetorician but also made a success of his epic in a revised form, for which the Rhodians gave him the 'freedom' of their city; hence his surname. On returning to Alexandria he recited his poem again, to applause. In 196 Ptolemy Epiphanes made him the librarian of the Museum (the university) at Alexandria.</p><p> Apollonius's <i>Argonautica</i> is one of the better minor epics, remarkable for originality, powers of observation, sincere feeling, and depiction of romantic love. His Jason and Medea are natural and interesting, and did much to inspire Virgil (in a very different setting) in the fourth book of the <i>Aeneid</i>.</p></p><p>The aim of the series remains that of including the works of all the principal classical authors. Although this has been largely accomplished, new volumes are still being published to fill the remaining gaps, and old editions are being revised in the light of recent research or replaced.Apollonius of Rhodes, Latin: Apollonius Rhodius), floruit first half of 3rd century BCE, is best known as the author of the Argonautica, an epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both innovative and influential, providing Ptolemaic Egypt with a "cultural mnemonic" or national "archive of images", and offering the Latin poets Virgil and Gaius Valerius Flaccus a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as Alexandria and Cnidus &#x2013; places of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the Library of Alexandria. A literary dispute with Callimachus, another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, athough there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation. Once considered a mere imitator of Homer, and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history.</p><h2>Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick</h2><p><b>"The only biography I've ever read that's as exciting as a spy novel . . . Phil Dick's life was as weird and mysterious as any of his science fiction books."--Robert Anton Wilson</b><br><i></i><i><br></i>With thirty-eight books currently in print and seven of his novels and short stories adapted into blockbuster films, Philip K. Dick is recognized worldwide as one of our time's greatest and most influential novelists. Lawrence Sutin's<i> Divine Invasions,</i> acknowledged by the Dick family as the official Philip K. Dick biography, illuminates the life of the man who loosed the bonds of the science-fiction genre and profoundly influenced such writers as Pynchon, Delillo, David Foster Wallace, and Jonathan Lethem. Absorbing, beautifully written, and profoundly revealing, <i>Divine</i> <i>Invasions </i>is a must-read for Dick fans and for all fans of contemporary fiction and film.<br></p><p>"Divine Invasions" is the first full-scale biography of Philip K. Dick, a brilliant writer who, working inside the science fiction field, created some of the most powerful and lasting visionary fiction of this century. This biography chronicles the story of a man whose life was truly as interesting as his own enduring work. <p>""Divine Invasions" is a perceptive introduction to Philip K. Dick's amazing talent. In Europe and Japan, Dick is regarded as a major American writer, without regard to genre. This new biography takes a large step toward earning Dick that same respect in his native country." -San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"A century from now, two or three of Dick's novels are likely to be among the books by which people will understand this era and its fascination with subliminal manipulation of consciousness and the general origins and limits of consciousness... Lawrence Sutin's biography is a highly informative and fascinating attempt at establishing the fundamentals of Dick's life and work... Extremely useful... is a twenty-page chronological guide to the novels... This biography makes you like Philip K. Dick and makes you want to read his books." -Hungry Mind Review </p><p>"It is difficult to praise this book highly enough... Philip K. Dick is finally being accorded the same depth and detail as subjects far less deserving. As scholarship and research, Sutin's efforts are impeccable. As literature, the book is at once absorbing, intelligent and eminently readable... A must-read book for anyone interested in the psychology and art of this fascinating figure." -Trajectories </p><p>"An incisive, conscientious biography. Bravo." -Art Spiegelman </p><p>"The only biography I've ever read that's as exciting as a spy novel...

Yet we so often fail to respond biblically to a fallen brother or sister. Sometimes we ignore the sin. Or we go to the other extreme and kick the sinner out of the church. We allow him to quietly disappear, never to face and overcome his wrong. Or we allow him to stay in the body, yet fail to truly forgive him or restore him to a place of effectiveness for his Lord. This story of one congregation&#39;s response to a member of its staff who had sinned is a triumph of love and restoration. Pastor Don Baker&#39;s search for the Bible&#39;s answers to each step of the church discipline process offers wisdom to all who seek hope for despair, renewal for brokenness, beauty for ashes.</p><p></p><h2>New York Times Heritage Cookbook: Over 2,000 of America&#39;s Favorite Recipes</h2><p>Contains more than 2,100 authentic heirloom recipes from six different regions of the United States, and highlights such tasty dishes as Louisiana Shrimp Gumbo, Cape Cod Clam Chowder, Pan-Fried Oregon Trout, and Pennsylvania Dutch Shoofly Pie.</p><p></p><h2>The Millionaire Maker</h2><p>New condition.

Although not as comprehensive as Patricia and Fredrick McKissack's The Black Diamond (Scholastic, 1994), Shadow Ball chronicles the history of the Negro Leagues and gives a good overview of this important and sad part of baseball's story. 25 Great Moments provides one or two page synopses of some of the most legendary events and moments from baseball's past, ranging from the first game in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1846 to Joe Carter's Series-winning home run in 1993. Who Invented the Game? has a misleading title since it deals with far more than merely the origins of baseball. In fact, each chapter of this book is a summary of an episode of the television series. Thus, it provides a condensed history of the game. In each of the books, the layout and photographs are excellent and the index is comprehensive. They all have some worthwhile elements, but they seem to have been produced simply as spin-offs of the documentary. With better and more substanial books in most collections, these titles are serviceable additions.?Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last Ditch (9) (Ciaphas Cain)</h2><p>Commissar Cain returns to an icy planet to crush a new wave of ork attacks, but inadvertently disturbs a far greater threat which has lain frozen and dormant for centuries in a new hardcover edition.<br><br>Imperial commissar Ciaphas Cain returns to Nusquam Fundumentibus to crush the ork attacks which have been plaguing the frozen planet.

The 1973 edition of <b>Nymphs</b> set forth his initial findings.

This two-volume work, revised upward from the original one-volume Nymphs, is an example of why. Quietly, Ernie spent the 33 intervening years since the 1973 original publication researching this, its successor. A classic over-achiever with doctorate and post doctorate degrees, Ernie devoted his life to pursuing the roots and truths of beauty in every form, from architecture to art, wine, history, philosophy, literature and his first and foremost love&#x2015;fly fishing. From the age of ten he was the quintessential hatch matcher and Nymphs is his crowning achievement in that art/science genre. Nymphs sets Ernie's new standard: one that will never be exceeded in fly-fishing literature. It was my great good fortune to have worked with him. Hail, Ernesto!&#x201d;&#x2015;John Randolph, Editor, Fly Fisherman<br>&#x201c;When you read one of Ernie Schwiebert's books you get taken on a journey. Rather than reading an instruction manual, you go to Iceland or Ireland or the Nerversink. You learn about the history of our famous rivers and about the culture that surrounds them. You are on the river with Schwiebert, hearing the sounds and smelling the aromas of a trout stream in June. And you get a glimpse into the true genius of a man who could not only figure out the mysteries of subsurface <br>feeding, but could also invent the pattern to match it, and draw the natural with spectacular beauty. I've had thousands of hours of pleasure with the original Nymphs over the past thirty years. To have a new and updated version with a whole world of new adventures is going to make this book valuable well into the 21st century.&#x201d;&#x2015;Tom Rosenbauer, author of The Orvis Fly-Fishing Guide<br>About the original, 1973 edition:<br>&#x201c;Few books in the entire history of fishing literature have constituted such a startling advance. Nymphs now seems to me to stand alone as the most accomplished solo writer-artist contribution to fly-fishing literature. With words and art, this book opened the eyes of the next two generations of fly fishers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Paul Schullery, author of American Fly Fishing: A HistoryErnest G. Schwiebert published the first edition of Nymphs in 1973 but never ceased working on the project, and over the next thirty years he continued his research into the entomology necessary to successful trout fishing. Fly <br>fishers in the early twenty-first century are accustomed to myriad types of artificial flies and approaches to catch trout, but back when there were still many anglers who populated a rules-bound world of dry flies and traditional wet flies, what Schwiebert said in the first edition of this book was novel and heretical. Vincent Marinaro, author of that touchstone American text, A Modern Dry-Fly Code, and hero to Schwiebert, refused to speak with the younger writer after Nymphs first appeared, as this new book promoted a violation of form that was unacceptable to the gentleman of the Letort Spring Run. Schwiebert, however, stood solidly behind his methods of identifying, tying, and fishing imitations of nymphs, a <br>revolution in the sport. Ultimately, critics hailed his highly original book as a landmark achievement in both the art and science of fly fishing, and thousands of anglers today carry fly boxes crammed with nymphs of various sizes and colors. <br>Now, the classic text has been fully revised and greatly expanded&#x2015;in two volumes&#x2015;and includes taxonomic details of multitudes of individual nymphs from many different insect genera, hundreds of recipes for imitations, and digitally remastered original illustrations and numerous new illustrations by the author. Schwiebert backs his text with authoritative support from the classic work of numerous entomologists, such as James Needham, Justin Leonard, Jay Traver, and George Edmunds, and colors it with his stories of fishing with legends of the sport, including John Hemingway, Charlie Fox, and Joe Brooks. This new Nymphs calls upon decades of angling experience&#x2015;years that connect extraordinarily different eras of fly-fishing&#x2015;to present a lasting, highly usable angler's entomology for all of North America.</p><h2>A Sand Book</h2><p><p><strong>Longlisted for the National Book Award</strong></p><p><strong>"Mind-blowing." &#x2015;Kim Gordon</strong></p><p>Deadpan, epic, and searingly charismatic, <em>A Sand Book</em> is at once relatable and out-of-this-world.

Her poems and various performances and even her posts are fetishes in a much deeper sense: they are sites of (and screens for) irrational and transpersonal powers. I am convinced of the authenticity of the summonses she receives and the summonses she issues and when I read her I am reminded that all of this is a calling before it&#x2019;s an identity or career.

We&#x2019;re going over there. Today,&#x201d; our mom said. And we knew what she meant. We&#x2019;d been over there to celebrate not celebrating Thanksgiving. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back then we lived in East Oakland, in a yellow house. It was the brightest but smallest house on the block. A two-bedroom with a tiny kitchen that couldn&#x2019;t even fit a table. I didn&#x2019;t love it there, the carpets were too thin and smelled like dirt and smoke. We didn&#x2019;t have a couch or TV at first, but it was definitely better than where we were before. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One morning our mom woke us up in a hurry, her face was beat up. She had a brown leather jacket way too big for her draped over her shoulders. Both her top and bottom lips were swollen. Seeing those big lips messed me up. She couldn&#x2019;t talk right. She told us to pack our things then too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jacquie's last name is Red Feather, and mine is Bear Shield.&nbsp;Both our dads had left our mom. That morning our mom came home beat up, we took the bus to a new house, the yellow house. I don&#x2019;t know how she got us a house. On the bus I moved closer to my mom and put a hand into her jacket pocket.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Why do we got names like we do?" I said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They come from old Indian names. We had our own way of naming before white people came over and spread all those dad names around in order to keep the power with the dads."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t understand this explanation about dads. And I didn&#x2019;t know if Bear Shield meant shields that bears used to protect themselves, or shields people used to protect themselves against bears, or were the shields themselves made out of bears? Either way it was all pretty hard to explain in school, how I was a Bear Shield, and that wasn&#x2019;t even the worst part. The worst part was my first name, which was two: Opal Viola. That makes me Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield. Victoria was our mom&#x2019;s name, even though she went by Vicky, and Opal Viola came from our grandma who we never met. Our mom told us she was a medicine woman and renowned singer of spiritual songs, so I was supposed to carry that big old name around with honor. The good thing was, the kids didn&#x2019;t have to do anything to my name to make fun of me, no rhymes or variations. They just said the whole thing and it was funny.<br>We got on a bus on a cold gray morning in late January 1970. Me and Jacquie had matching beat-up old red duffel bags that didn't hold much, but we didn't have much. I packed two outfits and tucked my teddy bear, Two Shoes, under my arm. The name Two Shoes came from my sister, because her childhood teddy bear only had one shoe the way they got it. Her bear wasn't named One Shoe, but maybe I should have considered myself lucky to have a bear with two shoes and not just one. But then bears don't wear shoes, so maybe I wasn't lucky either but something else.&nbsp;<br>Out on the sidewalk, our mom turned to face the house. "Say goodbye to it, girls."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd gotten used to keeping an eye on the front door. I'd seen more than a few eviction notices. And sure enough, one was right there. Our mom always kept them up so she could claim she never saw them, in order to buy time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Me and Jacquie looked up at the house. It'd been okay, the yellow house.&nbsp;For what it was. The first one we&#x2019;d been in without either of the dads, so it&#x2019;d been quiet, and even sweet, like the banana cream pie our mom made the first night we spent there, when the gas worked but the electricity hadn&#x2019;t been turned on yet, and we ate standing up in the kitchen, in candlelight.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were still thinking of what to say when our mom yelled &#x201c;Bus!&#x201d; and we had to scamper after her, dragging our matching red duffel bags behind us.<br>It was the middle of the day, so hardly anyone was on the bus. Jacquie sat a few seats back like she didn&#x2019;t know us, like she was riding alone. I wanted to ask my mom more about the island, but I knew she didn&#x2019;t like to talk on the bus. She turned like Jacquie. Like we all didn&#x2019;t know each other.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why should we speak our business around people we don&#x2019;t even know?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore. &#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;What are we doing?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to be with our relatives. Indians of All Tribes. We&#x2019;re going over to where they built that prison. Gonna start from the inside of the cell, which is where we are now, Indian people, that&#x2019;s where they got us, even though they don&#x2019;t make it seem like they got us there. We&#x2019;re gonna work our way out from the inside with a spoon. Here, look at this.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She handed me a laminated card from her purse the size of a playing card. It was that picture you see everywhere, the sad-Indian-on-a-horse silhouette, and on the other side it said <i>Crazy Horse&#x2019;s Prophecy</i>. I read it:<br><br>Upon suffering beyond suffering; the Red Nation shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for a sick world. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of seven generations, when all the colors of mankind will gather under the sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t know what she was trying to tell me with that card, or about the spoon. But our mom was like that. Speaking in her own private language. I asked her if there would be monkeys. I thought for some reason that all islands had monkeys. She didn&#x2019;t answer my question, she just smiled and watched the long gray Oakland streets stream by the bus window like it was an old movie she liked but had seen too many times to notice anymore.</p><h2>A Brace of Bloodhounds (Jo Beth Sidden, No. 3)</h2><p>With the help of her treasured bloodhounds, hard-nosed sleuth Jo Beth Siddon uncovers a ring of marijuana growers and follows a dangerous trail that takes her through the Okefenokee Swamp</p><p>Set in a locale and a culture as rich and satisfying as good Southern cooking, Virginia Lanier's <i>A Brace of Bloodhounds</i> continues the adventures of JoBeth Sidden. JoBeth's a feisty Southern gal with an attitude, whose devotion to her highly trained and trusted bloodhounds involves her in kidnapping, corruption, drug smuggling, and every ornery law-enforcement puzzle that comes to light in her South Georgia town on the edge of the Okeefenokee Swamp. Lanier's adrenalin-pumping narratives, which began with <i>The House on Bloodhound Lane</i> and continued in <i>Death in Bloodhound Red</i> and <i>Blind Bloodhound Justice</i>, are told by JoBeth, who is alternately pulled and pushed by her loves: her extended family of friends and trainers, and her wonderful and appealing bloodhounds. In this volume, JoBeth seeks answers to a petition from beyond the grave, unearths a child molester, and faces a renegade alligator who threatens her pups. Along the way, we learn the rich details of mantrailing, Southern hospitality, modern moonshining, and--of course--romance. Those who have already made the acquaintance of Lanier's appealing family of characters will enjoy this installment. Newcomers will be thrilled that there are other books in the series.

It presents haiku poets writing in English, Spanish, French, German, and five other languages on an equal footing with Japanese poets. Not only are the four great Japanese masters of the haiku represented (Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki) but also several major Western authors not commonly known to have written haiku. <br><br>The book presents a concise history of the Japanese haiku, including the dynamic changes throughout the twentieth century as the haiku has been adapted to suburban and industrial settings. Full chapters are offered on form, the seasons in haiku, and haiku craft, plus background on the Japanese poetic tradition, and the effect of translation on our understanding of haiku. <br><br>Other unique features are the lesson plans for both elementary and secondary school use; and lists of haiku publishers and magazines (in several languages). The Handbook concludes with a full reference section of haiku-related terms, bibliography, and a comprehensive season-word list to aid in understanding and appreciating Japanese haiku.</p><p><br>WILLIAM J. HIGGINGSON studied Japanese at Yale University where he discovered the haiku, and served, with the U.S. Air Force in Japan. He is a charter member of the Haiku Society of America, founded in 1968, and edited and published <em>Haiku Magazine</em> (1971-76). He has three published collections of longer poems and one of haiku, and has work appearing in magazines and anthologies worldwide. He has also taught in the National Endowment for the Arts "Poets-in-the Schools" program, leading writing workshops in hundreds of schools, and he regularly speaks at conferences in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. Higginson's international anthology of haiku for children, <em>Wind in the Long Grass</em>, is a classroom favorite. His two-volume sequel to <em>The Haiku Handbook</em>, <em>The Haiku Seasons</em> and <em>Haiku World</em>, gives a comprehensive view of the history, present state, and international possibilities of seasonal consciousness in poetry. <br><br>PENNY HARTER, Higginson's wife and collaborator on the Handbook, is a poet and teacher with 14 collections of poems to her credit. She has received three grants from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts for her poetry, and an award from the Poetry Society of America. She has served as a visiting poet for the Council and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation in classes from kindergarten through high school. Her work is published internationally; among her recent books are <em>Shadow Play: Night Haiku</em>, a collection for children, and her latest book, <em>Turtle Blessing</em>. The couple lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Harter teaches at Santa Fe Preparatory School.<br>[Following is the first section in Chapter 1, "Why Haiku?"] <p>Haiku Happen </p><p>We often see or sense something that gives us a bit of a lift, or a moment's pure sadness. Perhaps it is the funnies flapping in the breeze before a newsstand on a sunny spring day. Or some scent on the wind catches us as we step from the bus, or bend to lift the groceries from the car. Something tickles our ankle and, looking down to see what it is, we see more: </p><p>a baby crab<br> climbs up my leg--<br> such clear water </p><p>Or we are lying awake, alone with our thoughts, and as we turn to look at the clock </p><p>at midnight<br> a distant door<br> pulled shut </p><p>and we find ourselves more alone, because of the being on the other side of that door, than when we had no thoughts for others anywhere in the world. </p><p>The first of these two short poems was written about three hundred years ago by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho. The second is by a twentieth-century Japanese poet, Ozaki Hosai. Both poems are haiku. </p><p>Moments that can give rise to haiku are not foreign to the Americas. Mark Cramer has translated the following poem, originally written in Spanish by the Mexican poet Jose Juan Tablada a few years before Hosai wrote "at midnight": </p><p>Tender willow<br> almost gold, almost amber,<br> almost light... </p><p>And just recently New Jerseyan Penny Harter found </p><p>the old doll<br> her mama box broken<br> to half a cry </p><p>Haiku happen all the time, wherever there are people who are "in touch" with the world of their senses, and with their own feeling response to it.</p></p><h2>Drive On!: A Social History of the Motor Car</h2><p>Stimulating, informative, provocative, and witty, <i>Drive On!</i> charts the international history of the car, decade by decade, examining how cars have adapted as a result of what society has demanded of them.

Against a background of cultural paradigm shifts including the advent of space travel, pop art, and mod fashion, and seminal events like the Kennedy/Nixon election, the Marianne Faithfull/Mick Jagger romance, the rise of the Hippie movement, and the riotous explosion of America&#x2019;s inner cities, <em>The Sixties </em>follows Isherwood&#x2019;s friendships with creative powerhouses such as Francis Bacon, David Hockney, Richard Burton, and Gore Vidal, and continues the saga of his great romance with portraitist Don Bachardy. </p></p><p><p>This second volume of Christopher Isherwood's remarkable diaries opens on his fifty-sixth birthday, as the fifties give way to the decade of social and sexual revolution. Isherwood takes the reader from the bohemian sunshine of Southern California to a London finally swinging free of post-war gloom, to the racy cosmopolitanism of New York and to the raw Australian outback. He charts his ongoing quest for spiritual certainty under the guidance of his Hindu guru, and he reveals in reckless detail the emotional drama of his love for the American painter Don Bachardy, thirty years his junior and struggling to establish his own artistic identity.</p><p>The diaries are crammed with wicked gossip and probing psychological insights about the cultural icons of the time&#x2014;Francis Bacon, Richard Burton, Leslie Caron, Marianne Faithfull, David Hockney, Mick Jagger, Hope Lange, W. Somerset Maugham, John Osborne, Vanessa Redgrave, Tony Richardson, David O. Selznick, Igor Stravinsky, Gore Vidal, and many others. But the diaries are most revealing about Isherwood himself&#x2014;his fiction (including <em>A Single Man</em> and <em>Down There on a Visit</em>), his film writing, his college teaching, and his affairs of the heart. He moves easily from Beckett to Brando, from arthritis to aggression, from Tennessee Williams to foot powder, from the opening of <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway (which he skipped) to a close analysis of Gide.</p><p>In the background run references to the political and historical events of the period: the anxieties of the Cold War, Yuri Gagarin's spaceflight, de Gaulle and Algeria, the eruption of violence in America's inner cities, the Vietnam War, the Summer of Love, the moon landing, and the raising and lowering of hemlines. Isherwood is well known for his prophetic portraits of a morally bankrupt Europe on the eve of World War II; in this unparalleled chronicle, <em>The Sixties</em>, he turns his fearless eye on the decade that more than any other has shaped the way we live now.</p><p>Christopher Isherwood (1904&#x2013;1986) was one of the most prominent writers of his generation. He is the author of many works of fiction, including <em>All the Conspirators</em>, <em>The Memorial</em>, <em>Mr. Norris Changes Trains</em>, and <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em>, on which the musical <em>Cabaret</em> was based, as well as works of nonfiction and biography.</p></p><h2>Basic Christianity (IVP Classics)</h2><p>In 2006, <em>Christianity Today</em> voted this title to be one of the top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals! Who is Jesus? "If Jesus was not God in human flesh, Christianity is exploded," writes John Stott. "We are left with just another religion with some beautiful ideas and noble ethics; its unique distinction has gone." If Jesus is not who he said he was, and if he did not do what he said he had come to do, the whole superstructure of Christianity crumbles in ruins to the ground. Is it plausible that Jesus was truly divine? And what might this mean for us? John Stott's clear, classic statement examines the historical facts on which Christianity stands. Here is a sound, sensible guide for all who seek an intellectually satisfying explanation of the Christian faith.</p><p>&#34;John Stott&#39;s books have helped millions around the world to a better understanding of the Christian faith. I, for one, am extremely grateful for the way in which he explains complex and difficult issues with great clarity, insight and wisdom.

As the author reminds us, imitations of the latter's work adorn the walls of French-themed bars worldwide and have become a shorthand for sanitized debauchery. Toulouse-Lautrec--absinthe drinker and brothel frequenter--was instrumental in the development of the poster, but what is his artistic legacy? Although Toulouse-Lautrec dominates the book's subtitle, Sweetman's sweep is much grander. In much the same way as his main subject was, Sweetman proves a sympathetic host to the women of Montmartre, tragic figures such as La Goulue, Jane Avril, and Suzanne Valadon, and he is particularly insightful on the singer Aristide Bruant's influence on the fledgling artist. However, the amount of tertiary detail, allied to an ambitious attempt to run a parallel life of Oscar Wilde, tends to be a little too much for the author to handle at times. Sweetman's demands for Toulouse-Lautrec's art to be taken more seriously--for people to look beyond the scenes of dancing and drinking--appear overstated, especially when the painter appears, at best, morally mercenary. Of course, Lautrec was more than a "deformed man who saw ugliness in everything." His work influenced Picasso, Seurat, and van Gogh and was part of a vanguard of realism in French art that swept it into the 20th century and helped establish graphic art as the people's art. It also had the dubious distinction of paving the way for popular culture as we now know it. Hamstrung by a lack of color plates, Sweetman's book is nonetheless a worthy and well-told account of a pivotal time. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i><b>David Sweetman</b> is a biographer, art historian, and poet.

Not bad for a story that is often as gripping as, well, an Ayn Rand novel. -- <i>Judge Alex Kozinski, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></i><br><br>An intensely personal story of the making of a powerful intellectual movement that helped shape the policy changes now rocking the world. the story will appall some, anguish others, and intrigue and excite everyone. -- <i>Martin Anderson, The Hoover Institute</i><br><br>Branden faced up to the issues with really admirable courage and frankness....A quite extraordinary book. -- <i>Colin Wilson, Author of <i>The Outsider</i></i><br><br>Branden's riveting book has love, philosophy and mystery...an unparalleled investigative memoir about people who have shaped our world view. -- <i>Warren Bennis, Distinguished Professor of Business Administration, USC, and author of <i>Why Leaders Can't Lead</i></i><br><br>It struck me as non-stop theatre. All the ingredients are there: conflict, colorful characters, suspense, and a Greek inevitability of tragedy born of hubris. There are scenes that collect energy and explode just this side of melodrama. There's a nexus of sex nearly dizzying in its permutations-and a confrontation climax to delight the heart of any dramatist. Judgment Day is a novel, a drama, a memoir; and most of all, one suspects, an act of catharsis demanding great courage of its author. -- <i>Dale Wasserman, Playwright and sreenwriter <i>Man of La Mancha, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i></i><br><br>Judgment Day is the story of an intensely passionate man who loves four very different women, the universe of ideas, and the infinite possibilities of life. Truly stimulating whether or not you care about Ayn Rand, Objectivism or Nathaniel Branden. And if you do care-an incredible feast. -- <i>Jeremy P. Tarcher, President, Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc.</i><br><br>Utterly compelling -- <i>Robin Mather, <i>Detroit News</i></i><br><br>What a story! It's heroic, romantic, deadly, horrifyng, tender-and I couldn't put it down. -- <i>George Leonard, former Look editor, a founder of the Esalen Institute, and author of <i>Walking on the Edge of the World</i></i>Branden's long, tedious account of his 18-year relationship with Ayn Rand is weighted with self-dramatization. The domineering author of The Fountainhead was 25 years his senior when they met in 1950; both were married yet carried on an affair. Branden writes that in 1968, when Rand discovered he was having an affair with Patrecia Gullison, an actress-model who became his second wife, Rand violently severed their relationship and excommunicated him from the inner circle of the Objectivist movement, of which Branden had been a chief disciple. After Patrecia drowned in 1977, Branden's third wife, Devers, formed a friendship with Rand, who still refused to speak to Branden. As he set tles scores with colleagues here and tests his theory of the psychology of romantic love, he also tests the reader's patience; nevertheless, Rand devotees will likely relish the steamy details of her personal life.

In it, Gilles Deleuze and F�lix Guattari set forth the following theory: Western society's innate herd instinct has allowed the government, the media, and even the principles of economics to take advantage of each person's unwillingness to be cut off from the group. What's more, those who suffer from mental disorders may not be insane, but could be individuals in the purest sense, because they are by nature isolated from society. More than twenty-five years after its original publication, <i>Anti-Oedipus</i> still stands as a controversial contribution to a much-needed dialogue on the nature of free thinking.<br><br></p><p>This is an essential text for feminists, literary theorists, social scientists, philosophers, and others interested in the problems of contemporary Western culture.Felix Guattari (1930-1992) was a French psychoanalyst, philosopher, social theorist and radical activist.

America's fear, lust, and loathing of Black male sexuality and humanity drives Joe mad.

Also, the heat makes of neighborhood a genuine thing, people are out on lawns or porches; they are exhausted, happy, beneficent, less ambitious than in any other season, and they are full of the beautiful cloudy stuff of dreams."<br><br><i>A Dream of Summer</i> assembles thirty-seven evocative poems on the experience and joy of summertime. Illustrated throughout with pen-and-ink drawings, this volume focuses on the sensuality of summertime and the varieties of summer experience. It is a love letter to the sultry heat, crashing thunderstorms, endless days, and short, mild nights.

Reprint.</p><p>What distinguishes this book from numerous others (some 150) published on Columbus in this century is Sale's attempt to separate the man from the legend. He returns to the original sources to take stock of the "historical Columbus" and then traces the growth of the "heroic Columbus." Overall, his portrait of Columbus is not flattering. A rootless man who never fully understood the enormity of his discovery, Columbus spent his declining years making unreasonable demands of his sovereigns for his heirs. Sale reminds us that part of the Columbian legacy was environmental despoliation and destruction of native cultures. Most fascinating is his tracing of the Columbus legend from its origins in the 16th century to the present. The story of his transformation from a simple sea captain to a tragic hero is an engaging one, well told and copiously documented here. In the flood of new Columbus scholarship, this certainly merits a place on all libraries' shelves. BOMC and Quality Paperback Book Club alternates.<br><i>- Brian E. Coutts, Western Ken tucky Univ. Libs., Bowling Green</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This demythologizing biographical adventure credits Columbus with the birth of American slavery and Euro-colonialism, and examines how peaceful Native Americans saw their societies and environments plundered by the whites' encroachments.

Observer</p><h2>What Do I Say?: Talking with Patients about Spirituality (with DVD)</h2><p><p></p>Health care professionals, clergy, chaplains, social workers, and others who counsel people in medical crisis often find themselves faced with deeply painful questions: <i>Why is this happening to me? Am I dying? Why should I live? I'm just a burden to others.</i>Here is a workbook that suggests healing verbal responses to such expressions of spiritual pain. The accompanying DVD helps reinforce the lessons and exercises that integrate psychology, psychiatry, pastoral counseling, nursing, chaplaincy, and spiritual direction for whole person care.The author, an internationally recognized expert in spiritual caregiving, points out that wanting to help is one motivation for learning these skills, but there are also evidence-based reasons: helping patients express their innermost feelings promotes spiritual healing; spiritual health is related to physical and emotional health; spiritual coping helps patients accept and deal with their illness; and patients tend to want their health care professionals to know about their spirituality.Lessons, tips, and exercises teach how to listen effectively, with guidelines for detecting and understanding the spiritual needs embedded in patients' conversations. Suggestions are provided for verbal responses to patients who express spiritual distress, including tips for building rapport, using self-disclosure, and praying with patients. A FAQ section deals with frequently asked questions and miscellaneous information, such as: �What do I do when a patient talks on and on and I have to leave?<br> �How do I answer a "why" question?<br> �What do I say to a patient who believes a miracle will happen to cure them?<br> �What if I'm not religious? How can I talk about it?<br>By practicing and using these healing techniques, Taylor explains, healthcare professionals will be able to provide patients responses to their questions that allow them to become intellectually, emotionally, and physically aware of their spirituality so they can experience life more fully.<p></p></p><p>Elizabeth Johnston Taylor, Ph.D., R.N., has a Ph.D. in Nursing and an M.S.N. in Oncology Nursing from the University of Pennsylvania, as well as training in chaplaincy and spiritual direction.

But as a coon dog, this loyal mongrel with his cavernous bark is unmatched. When the African American sharecropper who has raised Sounder from a pup is hauled off to jail for stealing a hog, his family must suffer their humiliation and crushing loss with no recourse. To make matters worse, in the fracas, Sounder is shot and disappears. The eventual return of a tattered and emaciated Sounder doesn't change the fact that the sharecropper's oldest son is forced to take on man's work to help support the family. His transition to adulthood is paved by the rocks and taunts hurled at him by convicts and guards as he searches for his father. But along this rough road he ultimately finds salvation as well.<p> William H.

Both are pretty good movies, but the novels are much better. Today Leonard writes mostly "crime" novels, labeled as such because his characters struggle to be good in a world so full of temptation that some kind of crime is <i>always</i> involved. <p> <i>Cuba Libre</i> finds Leonard reaching for a broader audience than those which appreciated either his crime novels or the westerns he once wrote, which he accomplishes by combining elements of both. Ben Tyler is a cowboy who robs banks, but only those that contain money of people who owe but won't pay him--he only takes what they owe. Charlie Burke is a businessman who buys horses cheap in the west, then sells them to exporters, while heroine Amelia Brown is the mistress of one of the truly bad men in the novel and struggles with dilemmas similar to those endured by other cast members. </p><p> Begining around the time that the <i>Maine</i> is sunk in Havana Harbor and ending when Teddy and others storm San Juan Hill, the story is at its best when its colorful characters are turned loose in one of the novel's colorful settings. If you like Leonard, you'll love <i>Cuba Libre</i>, and if--for some reason--you haven't yet discovered the author, prepare for a real treat.</p><p>War in Cuba isn't Ben Tyler's concern. Still, sailing mares and guns into Havana harbor in 1898--right past the submerged wreckage of the U.S. battleship <em>Maine</em>--may not be the smartest thing the recently prison-sprung horse wrangler ever did. Neither is shooting one of the local Guardia, though the pompous peacock deserved it. Now Tyler's sitting tight in a vermin-infested Cuban stockade waiting to face a firing squad. But he's not dying until he gets the money he's owed from a two-timing American sugar baron. And there's one smart, pistol-hot lady at the rich man's side who could help Ben get everything he's got rightfully coming...even when the whole damn island's going straight to hell.</p></p><h2>Red Cat, Blue Cat</h2><p><p>Fur flies and feline friendships form as cats of different colors find that, with a little effort, they make a purr-fect blend!

Here, as in all his works, he sees religion as the dynamic element of culture. He shares with Arnold Toynbee the ideal of a universal spiritual society as the goal of history; but whereas Dr. Toynbee sees this as to be achieved by a consensus of the great world religions, East and West, Dawson sees it as coming from the working out of the Catholic principle. </p><p> "Catholicism does not rest on the consensus of human wisdom--even on its highest and most spiritual plane--but on a divine revelation which is also an act of creation." The Church is, in his view, just such a society working as a leaven in history; its role in history is that of healing the divisions of humanity by bringing back the nations into spiritual unity. </p><p> This work by Dawson has all the qualities which have earned him international acclaim as an historian and as a Christian Humanist.</p></p><p>Christopher Henry Dawson was a British independent scholar, who wrote many books on cultural history and Christendom.</p><h2>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway</h2><p>Motivational book for business leaders and people confronting hardship on facing and overcoming their demons and daunting challenges.</p><p>Dynamic and inspirational, FEEL THE FEAR AND DO IT ANYWAY is filled with concrete techniques to turn passivity into asssertiveness.

A migraine is two hundred. <br>&nbsp;<br>Not that I get the money. The company gets it. What I get is twelve dollars an hour, plus reimbursement for painkillers. Not that they work. <br>&nbsp;<br>I feel pain for money. Other people&#x2019;s pain. Physical, emotional, you name it. <br>&nbsp;<br>Pain is an illusion, I know, and so is time, I know, I know. I know. The shift manager never stops reminding us. Doesn&#x2019;t help, actually. Doesn&#x2019;t help when you are on your third broken leg of the day. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>I get to work three minutes late and already there are nine tickets in my inbox. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, open the first ticket of the morning: <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m at a funeral. <br>&nbsp;<br>Feeling grief. <br>&nbsp;<br>Someone else&#x2019;s grief. Like wearing a stranger&#x2019;s coat, still warm with heat from another body. <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m feeling a mixture of things. <br>&nbsp;<br>Grief, mostly, but also I detect some guilt in there. There usually is. <br>&nbsp;<br>I hear crying. <br>&nbsp;<br>I am seeing crying faces. Pretty faces. Crying, pretty, white faces. Nice clothes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our services aren&#x2019;t cheap. As the shift manager is always reminding us. <i>Need I remind you? </i>That is his favorite phrase these days. He is always walking up and down the aisle tilting his head into our cubicles and saying it. <i>Need I remind you, </i>he says, <i>of where we are on the spectrum? </i>In terms of low-end high-end? We are solidly toward the highish end. So the faces are usually pretty, the clothes are usually nice. The people are usually nice, too. Although I imagine it&#x2019;s not such a big deal to be nice when you&#x2019;re that rich and that pretty. <br>&nbsp;<br>There&#x2019;s a place in Hyderabad doing what we&#x2019;re doing, but a little more toward the budget end of things. Precision Living Solutions, it&#x2019;s called. And of course there are hundreds of emotional engineering firms here in Bangalore, springing up everywhere you look. The other day I read in the paper that a new call center opens once every three weeks. Workers follow the work, and the work is here. All of us ready to feel, to suffer. We&#x2019;re in a growth industry. <br>&nbsp;<br>Okay. The body is going into the ground now. The crying is getting more serious. <br>&nbsp;<br>Here it comes. <br>&nbsp;<br>I am feeling that feeling. The one that these people get a lot, near the end of a funeral service. These sad and pretty people. It&#x2019;s a big feeling. Different operators have different ways to describe it. For me, it feels something like a huge boot. Huge, like it fills up the whole sky, the whole galaxy, all of space. Some kind of infinite foot. And it&#x2019;s stepping on me. The infinite foot is stepping on my chest. <br>&nbsp;<br>The funeral ends, and the foot is still on me, and it is hard to breathe. People are getting into black town cars. I also appear to have a town car. I get in. The foot, the foot. So heavy. Here we go, yes, this is familiar, the foot, yes, the foot. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt, exactly. It&#x2019;s not what I would call comfortable, but it&#x2019;s not pain, either. More like pressure. Deepak, who used to be in the next cubicle, once told me that this feeling I call the infinite foot&#x2014;to him it felt more like a knee&#x2014;is actually the American experience of the Christian God. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you sure it is the Christian God?&#x201d; I asked him. &#x201c;I always thought God was Jewish.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same guy. Duh. The Judeo-Christian God.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; I said. He just shook his head at me. We&#x2019;d had this conversation before. I figured he was probably right, but I didn&#x2019;t want to admit it. Deepak was the smartest guy in our cube-cluster, as he would kindly remind me several times a day. <br>&nbsp;<br>I endure a few more minutes of the foot, and then, right before the hour is up, right when the grief and guilt are almost too much and I wonder if I am going to have to hit the safety button, there it is, it&#x2019;s usually there at the end of a funeral, no matter how awful, no matter how hard I am crying, no matter how much guilt my client has saved up for me to feel. You wouldn&#x2019;t expect it&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;but anyone who has done this job for long enough knows what I&#x2019;m talking about, and even though you know it&#x2019;s coming, even though you are, in fact, waiting for it, when it comes, it is always still a little bit of a shock. <br>&nbsp;<br>Relief. <br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>Death of a cousin is five hundred. Death of a sibling is twelve fifty. Parents are two thousand apiece, but depending on the situation people will pay all kinds of money, for all kinds of reasons, for bad reasons, for no reason at all. <br>&nbsp;<br>The company started off in run-of-the-mill corporate services, basic stuff: ethical qualm transference, plausible deniability. The sort of things that generated good cash flow, cash flow that was fed right back into R&amp;D, year after year, turning the little shop into a bit player, and then a not-so-bit player, and then, eventually, into a leader in a specialized market. In those early days, this place was known as Conscience Incorporated. The company had cornered the early market in guilt. <br>&nbsp;<br>Then the technology improved. Some genius in Delhi had figured out a transfer protocol to standardize and packetize all different kinds of experiences. Overnight, everything changed. An industry was born. The business of bad feeling. For the right price, almost any part of life could be avoided.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;***<br>&nbsp;<br>Across the street from work is a lunch place I go to sometimes. Not much, really, a hot and crowded little room, a bunch of stools in front of a greasy counter. I come here mostly for the small television, up on a shelf, above the cash register. They have a satellite feed. <br>&nbsp;<br>Today they have it switched to American television, and I am watching a commercial for our company&#x2019;s services. <br>&nbsp;<br>It shows a rich executive-looking type sitting and rubbing his temples, making the universal television face for I Am an Executive in a Highly Stressful Situation. There are wavy lines on either side of his temples to indicate that the Executive is really stressed! Then he places a call to his broker and in the next scene, the Executive is lying on a beach, drinking golden beer from a bottle and looking at the bluest ocean I have ever seen. <br>&nbsp;<br>Next to me is a woman and her daughter. The girl, maybe four or five, is scooping rice and peas into her mouth a little at a time. She is watching the commercial in silence. When she sees the blue water, she turns to her mother and asks her, softly, what the blue liquid is. I am thinking about how sad it is that she has never seen water that color in real life until I realize that I am thirty-nine years old and hey, you know what? Neither have I. <br>&nbsp;<br>And then the commercial ends with one of our slogans. <br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Don&#x2019;t feel like having a bad day? </i><br><i>Let someone else have it for you. </i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>That someone else they are talking about in the commercial is me. And the other six hundred terminal operators in Building D, Cubicle Block 4. Don&#x2019;t feel like having a bad day? Let me have it for you. <br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s okay for me. It&#x2019;s a good job. I didn&#x2019;t do that well in school, after all. It was tougher for Deep. He did three semesters at technical college. He was always saying he deserved better. Better than this, anyway. I would nod and agree with him, but I never told him what I wanted to tell him, which was, hey, Deepak, when you say that you deserve better, even if I agree with you, you are kind of also implying that I don&#x2019;t deserve better, which, maybe I don&#x2019;t, maybe this is about where I belong in the grand scheme of things, in terms of high-end low-end for me as a person, but I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t say it because whenever you do, it makes me feel a sharp bit of sadness and then, for the rest of the day, a kind of low-grade crumminess. <br>&nbsp;<br>Whenever Deep and I used to go to lunch, he would try to explain to me how it works. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay, so, the clients,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;they call in to their account reps and book the time.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>He liked to start sentences with okay, so. It was a habit he had picked up from the engineers. He thought it made him sound smarter, thought it made him sound like them, those code jockeys, standing by the coffee machine, talking faster than he could think, talking not so much in sentences as in data structures, dense clumps of logic with the occasional inside joke. He liked to stand near them, pretending to stir sugar into his coffee, listening in on them as if they were speaking a different language. A language of knowing something, a language of being an expert at something. A language of being something more than an hourly unit. <br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, so, Deepak said, so this is how it works. The client, he books the time, and then at the appointed hour, a switch in the implant chip kicks on and starts transferring his consciousness over. Perceptions, sensory data, all of it. Then it goes first to an intermediate server for processing and then gets bundled with other jobs, and then a huge block of the stuff gets zapped over here, where it gets downloaded onto our servers and then dumped into our queue management system, which parcels out the individual jobs to all of us in the cubicle farm. <br>&nbsp;<br>Okay, so, it&#x2019;s all based on some kind of efficiency algorithm&#x2014;our historical performance, our current emotional load. Sensors in our head assembly unit measure our stress levels, sweat composition, to see what we can handle. Okay? he would say, when he was done. Like a professor. He wanted so badly to be an expert at something. <br>&nbsp;<br>I always appreciated Deepak trying to help me understand. But it&#x2019;s just a job, I would say. I never really understood why Deep thought so much of those programmers, either. In the end, we&#x2019;re all brains for hire. Mental space for rent, moments as a commodity. They have gotten it down to a science. How much a human being can take in a given twelve-hour shift. Grief, embarrassment, humiliation, all different, of course, so they calibrate our schedules, mix it up, the timing and the order, and the end result is you leave work every day right about at your exact breaking point. A lot of people smoke to take the edge off. I quit twelve years ago, so sometimes when I get home, I&#x2019;m still shaking for a little bit. I sit on my couch and drink a beer and let it subside. Then I heat up some bread and lentils and read a newspaper or, if it&#x2019;s too hot to stay inside, go down to the street and eat my dinner standing there, watching people walking down the block, wondering where they are headed, wondering if anyone is waiting for them to come home. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>**The above is an excerpt from &#x201c;Standard Loneliness Package,&#x201d; the first story in the new collection SORRY PLEASE THANK YOU </i>by Charles Yu<i>.**</i></p></p><h2>Jaco</h2><p>(Book).

The book describes a new energy in nature that produces a very long range information entanglement and appears to be related to movement of magnetic charge in the vacuum level of reality. Finally, it uses the experimental data to formulate theoretically a new reference frame for viewing nature, one that encompasses both conventional spacetime science and the new psychoenergetic phenomena.</p><p>NAWILLIAM A. TILLER, PH.D. Fellow to the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, Professor Emeritus William A. Tiller, of Stanford University&#x2019;s Department of Materials Science, spent 34 years in academia after 9 years as an advisory physicist with the Westinghouse Research Laboratories. In his conventional science field he has published over 250 scientific papers, 4 books and several patents. In parallel, for the past 30 years, he has been avocationally pursuing serious experimental and theoretical study of the field of psychoenergetics which he thinks will become a very important part of &#x201c;tomorrow&#x2019;s&#x201d; physics. In this new area, he has published to date, an additional 100 scientific papers and two seminal books.WALTER E. DIBBLE, JR. Dr. Dibble received his Ph.D. in Geochemistry at Stanford University in 1980 and did post-doctoral studies with William Tiller in the department of Materials Science and Engineering until 1982. He worked in industry in engineering geology until 1997 when again he worked with Dr. Tiller as a visiting scholar at Stanford. Since then he has been employed at Ditron, LLC and the William A. Tiller Foundation for New Science conducting experiments using intention imprinted electronic devices. Fields of specialization include aqueous geochemistry, crystal growth, engineering geology and subtle energy research. He has published several scientific papers in the field of geochemistry and more recently in the newly emerging field of subtle energy. J.

Eudora Welty is one of the very few whose great talent has been expressed in both photographs and fiction.</p><p>This book brings together in one volume about 250 representative photographs from the few thousand that she took during the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Although her camera's view finder compresses much, like the frame in which she conceives her fiction, it finds elements that convey her deep compassion and her artist's sensibilities.</p><p>From the confines of her native Mississippi, these photographs unfold the world of Eudora Welty's art, reaching, extending, and exploring. In the Deep South of Depression times, when she began writing, she discovered the place into which she had been born and which would always be her subject. From here, as these photographs show, she approached and risked the outside world. From rural Mississippi to New Orleans, Charleston, New York City, and Yaddo, and then to Ireland, England, and the Continent, Welty widened her vision and expanded her art. These photographs reveal that both in her fiction and in the pictures she took it has always been in place, in the special qualities of what is local, that she found her impulse. "I was smitten by the identity of place wherever I was," she said in 1989, "from Mississippi on--I still am."</p><p>The legions of appreciators of Welty's photographs see in them the feelings and vision that are the hallmarks of her great literary art in such novels as <i>Losing Battles</i> and <i>The Optimist's Daughter</i>, in her memoir <i>One Writer's Beginnings</i>, and in her volumes of short stories.</p><p>This serves as a definitive book of Welty's photographs, compromising pictures from her personal collection, from the repository of Welty materials at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, and from <i>One Time, One Place</i>, an album of her Depression-era photographs published in 1971.</p><p>Included are Mississippi scenes and people, emblems of folklife, carnival signs and performers, photographs taken in Charleston; New Orleans; Mexico; New York City; Ireland; Paris; Nice; Italy; Wales; and Saratoga Springs, New York, and a significant group of Welty's portraits of family members and friends.</p></p><p>The radiant world of Eudora Welty&#39;s art is charged by a poignant and familiar beauty, and here in a stunning book of her photographic work is a dazzling record of this writer&#39;s unique and special vision<b>Eudora Welty</b> (1909&#x2013;2001) is the author of many novels and story collections, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning novel <i>The Optimist&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, <i>Losing Battles</i>, <i>The Ponder Heart</i>, <i>The Robber Bridegroom</i>, <i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i>, as well as collections of her photographic work <i>Country Churchyards </i>and <i>One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression</i>, both published by University Press of Mississippi.</p><h2>Moon Lander: How We Developed the Apollo Lunar Module</h2><p>Chief engineer Thomas J.

It was, he writes, &#x201c;an aerospace engineer&#x2019;s dream job of the century.&#x201d; Kelly&#x2019;s account begins with the imaginative process of sketching solutions to a host of technical challenges with an emphasis on safety, reliability, and maintainability. He catalogs numerous test failures, including propulsion-system leaks, ascent-engine instability, stress corrosion of the aluminum alloy parts, and battery problems, as well as their fixes under the ever-present constraints of budget and schedule. He also recaptures the exhilaration of hearing Apollo 11&#x2019;s Neil Armstrong report that &#x201c;The Eagle has landed,&#x201d; and the pride of having inadvertently provided a vital &#x201c;lifeboat&#x201d; for the crew of the disabled Apollo 13.</p><p>The recipient of a Grumman Engineering Scholarship upon graduating from high school, <b>Thomas J.

First we beheld the brilliant orange flame of the Saturn 1B, then the agonizing wait until the hold-down clamps were released and the rocket began its slow climb upward alongside the launch tower finally clearing it. Then came the heavy, deep-throated roar of the mighty engines, simultaneously pressing down from the sky and upward, like an earthquake, from below the ground. Set majestically against the rose, purple, and deep blue of the dusky sky, the blazing torch of the rocket lit up the approaching night for miles around. It was a thrilling sight but also reminded me of the inherent risk of our whole enterprise.

Beyond a wall of ripped-�up city, the Nazis were shooting.<br><br>Past the barricade and a line of tailors&#x2019; mannequins assembled in a crude and motionless cancan, Thibaut could see the khaki of scattering Wehrmacht men, gray dress uniforms, SS black, the blue of the Kriegsmarine, all lit up by the flares of weapons. Something sped along the rue de Paradis, weaving in a howl of rubber between bodies and ruins, coming straight at the Germans.<br><br>Two women on a tandem? They came very fast on big wheels.<br><br>The soldiers shot, reloaded, and ran because the rushing vehicle did not turn or fall under their onslaught. There was a whir of chains.<br><br>Only one woman rode, Thibaut made out. The other was a torso, jutted from the bicycle itself, its moving prow, a figurehead where handlebars should be. She was extruded from the metal. She pushed her arms backward and they curled at the ends like coral. She stretched her neck and widened her eyes.<br><br>Thibaut swallowed and tried to speak, and tried again, and screamed, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the V�lo!&#x201d;<br><br>At once his comrades came. They pressed against the big window and stared down into the city gloom.<br><br>The Amateur of Velocipedes. Lurching through Paris on her thick-�spoked wheels singing a song without words. My God, Thibaut thought, because a woman was riding her, and that absolutely should not happen. But there she was, gripping the V�lo&#x2019;s wrist with one hand, pulling with the other on leather strapped tight around the cycle-�centaur&#x2019;s throat.<br><br>The V�lo moved faster than any car or horse, any devil Thibaut had yet seen, swaying between the fa�ades, dodging bullets. She tore through the last of the men and the line of figurines they&#x2019;d arranged. She raised her front wheel and hit the barricade, mounted the meters of plaster, stone, bone, wood, and mortar that blocked the street.<br><br>She rose. She hurled into the air above the soldiers, arced up, seeming to pause, falling at last through the invisible boundary between the ninth and tenth arrondissements. She landed hard on the Surrealist side of the street.<br><br>The V�lo bounced and twisted on her tires, slid sideways. She came to a stop, looking up at the window of the Main � plume&#x2019;s hideout, straight into Thibaut&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>He was first out of the room and down the splintering steps, almost falling from the doorway out into the darkening street. His heart shook him.<br><br>The passenger was sprawled on the cobbles where her mount had bucked. The V�lo reared above her on her hind wheel like a fighting horse. She swayed.<br><br>She looked at Thibaut with pupil-�less eyes the same color as her skin. The manif flexed her thick arms and reached up to snap the cord around her neck and let it fall. She rocked in the wind.<br><br>Thibaut&#x2019;s rifle dangled in his hands. At the edge of his vision he saw �lise lob a grenade over the barricade, in case the Germans were regrouping. The explosion made the ground and the barrier tremble, but Thibaut did not move.<br><br>The V�lo tipped forward, back onto both wheels. She accelerated toward him but he made himself stay still. She bore down and her wheels were a burr. Adrenaline took him with the certainty of impact, until on a final instant too quick to see she tilted and passed instead so close to him that Thibaut&#x2019;s clothes were tugged in the rush of her air.<br><br>Tires singing, the cycle-�presence wove between the shattered buildings of the Cit� de Tr�vise, into ruins and shadows, out of sight.<br><br>Thibaut at last exhaled. When he could control his shaking, he turned to the passenger. He went to where she lay.<br><br>The woman was dying. She had been hammered by the German fire the V�lo had ignored. Some fleeting influence at that powerful intersection of streets meant all the holes in her flesh were dry and puckered, but blood spilled from her mouth as if insisting on one outlet. She coughed and tried to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see?&#x201d; �lise was shouting. Thibaut knelt and put his hand on the fallen woman&#x2019;s forehead. The partisans gathered. &#x201c;She was riding the V�lo!&#x201d; �lise said. &#x201c;What does that mean? How in hell did she control it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not well,&#x201d; said Virginie.<br><br>The passenger&#x2019;s dark dress was dirty and ripped. Her scarf spread out on the road and framed her face. She furrowed her brow as if thoughtful. As if considering a problem. She was not much older than Thibaut, he thought. She looked at him with urgent eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . it&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s English,&#x201d; he said quietly.<br><br>C�dric stepped forward and tried to murmur prayers and Virginie shoved him sharply away.<br><br>The dying woman took Thibaut&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;He came. Wolf. Gang.&#x201d; She gasped out little bursts. Thibaut put his ear close to her mouth. &#x201c;Gerhard,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The doctor. The priest.&#x201d;<br><br>She was not looking at him any more, Thibaut realized, but past him, behind him. His skin itched in Paris&#x2019;s attention. He turned.<br><br>Behind the windows of the nearest building, overlooking them, a slowly shifting universe of fetal globs and scratches unfolded. A morass of dark colors, vivid on a blacker dark. The shapes rattled. They tapped the glass. A manif storm had come from within the house to witness this woman&#x2019;s death.<br><br>As everyone gathered watched the black virtue behind the windows, Thibaut felt the woman&#x2019;s fingers on his own. He gripped hers in turn. But she did not want a moment&#x2019;s last solicitude. She pried his hand open. She put something in it. Thibaut felt and knew instantly that it was a playing card.<br><br>When he turned back to her the woman was dead.<br><br>Thibaut was loyal Main � plume. He could not have said why he slipped the card into his pocket without letting his comrades see.<br><br>On the stones under the woman&#x2019;s other hand she had written letters on the road with her index finger as a nib. Her nail was wet with black ink from somewhere, provided by the city in that final moment of her need. She had written two last words.<br><br>FALL ROT.<br>Now it&#x2019;s months later, and Thibaut huddles in a Paris doorway, his hand in his pocket to hold that card again. Over his own clothes he wears a woman&#x2019;s blue-�and-�gold pajamas.<br><br>The sky is screaming. Two Messerschmitts come in below the clouds, chased by Hurricanes. Slates explode under British fire and the planes tear out of their dives. One of the German aircraft coils suddenly back in a virtuoso maneuver with weapons blazing and in a burning gust an RAF plane unfolds in the air, opening like hands, like a blown kiss, fire descending, turning an unseen house below to dust.<br><br>The other Messerschmitt veers toward the Seine. The roofs shake again, this time from below.<br><br>Something comes up from inside Paris.<br><br>A pale tree-�wide tendril, shaggy with bright foliage. It rises. Clutches of buds or fruit the size of human heads quiver. It blooms vastly above the skyline.<br><br>The German pilot flies straight at the vivid flowers, as if smitten, plant-�drunk. He plunges for the vegetation. It spreads trembling leaves. The great vine whips up one last house-�height and takes the plane in its coils. It yanks it down below the roofs, into the streets, out of sight.<br><br>There is no explosion. The snagged aircraft is just gone, into the deeps of the city.<br><br>The other planes frantically disperse. Thibaut waits while they go. He lets his heart slow. When he sets his face and steps out at last it is under a clean sky.<br><br>Thibaut is twenty-�four, hard and thin and strong. His eyes move constantly as he keeps watch in all directions: he has the fretful aggression and the gritted teeth of the new Parisian. He keeps his hair and his nails short. He squints with more than just suspicion: he does not have the spectacles he suspects he might need. Beneath his bright woman&#x2019;s nightclothes he wears a dirty darned white shirt, dark trousers and suspenders, worn black boots. It has been some days since Thibaut has shaved. He&#x2019;s scabbed and stinking.<br><br>Those pilots were foolhardy.

Salgado's powerful images of tea pickers in Rwanda, dam builders in India, steelworkers in France and the Ukraine, sugarcane harvesters in Brazil, assembly-line workers in Russia and China, sulfur miners in Indonesia and others pay moving tribute to the working people who, in Salgado's portrayal, have maintained their dignity under the harshest of conditions. Made over a period of six years, the 250 photographs comprising the series were first exhibited in 1993; for this publication, the project's original curator, Lelia Wanick Salgado, has narrowed the selection down to 81 photographs.

The book is also a monumental effort to capture voices long unheard and ensure that the words are not lost to a new generation. <p> </p><p> He includes statements from significant political and military figures from both sides of the conflict, including William Westmoreland, Alexander Haig, Nikita Kruschev's son Sergei, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Bihn. But he tempers these with the voices of a World Airways stewardess who accompanied troops out of the war zone, of the widow of the immolated Norman Morrison, and of numerous Vietnamese and American non-combatants whose lives were torn by the conflagration. These tales, and the contributions from poets, writers, and activists transform the book into a epic dialogue. Indeed, Appy says that he chose the title <i>Patriots</i> not out of a presumed understanding of how that word should be defined, but rather because it served as a locus for so many of the inner struggles of his interviewees: "In what ways might patriotism be a force for good or inspire noble sacrifice, and when does it become a club for stifling dissent and a rallying cry for unjustifiable destruction." </p><p> </p><p> <i>Patriots</i> is a book that will reawaken memories--horrific and jubilant--for those who lived through the troubled 1960s and 1970s; and for those just coming to understand the war, it will make vivid the trials of a different time and place. This is a lasting, powerful book that's essential reading for students of the Vietnam conflict. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Christian G.

Since then he has published four novels, two popular Oregon history books, and a collection of short stories, The Oregon Variations, that includes one story set in every county in the state.</p><h2>The Cat Who Sang for the Birds</h2><p>The twentieth offering in the consistently popular mystery series brings columnist Jim Qwilleran and his two prized pussycat sleuths, Koko and Yum Yum, out from their apple barn and on the case of arson at a new art center. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Lilian Jackson Braun began writing her Cat Who... detective series when one of her own Siamese cats mysteriously fell to its death from her apartment block. Since then over twenty Cat Who... novels have been published, all featuring the very talented Koko and Yum Yum. She and her husband, Earl, live in the mountains of North Carolina.More dire doings in Pickax (``400 miles north of everywhere''), where bachelor zillionaire Jim Qwilleran keeps a paternalistic eye on the town from his opulent barn house and his columnist job on Moose County Something, the local paper. Pickax has been saddened by the death of 93-year-old recluse Maude Coggin in a supposedly accidental fire in her decrepit house soon after she'd sold her hundred-acre farm, at a giveaway price, to buyers called Northern Land Improvement. Qwill's suspicions of this deal, reinforced by prescient cats Koko and Yum Yum, lead to his finding the company nonexistent. Some big-time chicanery is afoot, not to mention other odd happenings: a break-in and theft at the recently opened art center; an old scandal new to Qwill; the misgivings of boutique owner Elizabeth Hart about her boyfriend Derek's being offered a job as manager of Chet's Barbecuea downscale bar owned by town councilman Chet Ramsbottom. And then there's young butterfly-breeder Phoebe Sloan, whose unsavory boyfriend Jake is bartender at Chet's. When the town's major annual event takes placeit's a spelling beePhoebe is missing from her team. With help from Qwill and, of course, Koko and Yum Yum, the discovery of her body in Bloody Creek brings about the downfall of Pickax's corrupting elements. Braun's terminally arch mixture (The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, 1997, etc.) is even more extreme than before as confusion reigns, characters proliferate, and Qwill, with his second-sighted assistants, once more solves Pickax's problems. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This is the book to read to trigger the core of your remembrance of the great civilizations of Lemuria and Atlantis!</p><p>Altazar was the first book I have written. At the time, I was living as a hermit with my daughter in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona and had absolutely no intention of writing a book. Yet, this story came and would not go away. Finally, I thought I would write five or six pages and it might leave me alone. Several chapters later, I resigned myself to being an author! <p>The amazing thing about this book is the strong reaction of its readers who have been profoundly moved by it. This is because it is a powerful trigger to rememberance of our past life memories, especially those dealing with the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. "The Legend of Altazar" is one of those books which falls off the shelves into your hands, readily brings tears and flings open the doors to long suppressed memories. This act of remembrance is an important part of our ongoing process of liberation and wholeness. To be who we truly are, we must first remember all that we have been, for these distant memories have merged into our cells and affect everything we do. </p><p>Many people have found themselves within this story. Over the years, I've been contacted by numerous people who are positive that they are one of the characters in "The Legend of Altazar". Such strong identification happens because the characters are such true archetypes for humanity. We all contain part of each of these characters within our own beings. That's why they resonate so strongly with us. There have been literally hundreds of people contacting me who are convinced that they are the real Altazar. Currently, I am working on the screenplay for Altazar since it would make such a fantastic film, one with great entertainment value, yet one which would also be a powerful tool of transformation.</p>Solara is one of the foremost visionaries of our time who is widely respected for her integrity, courage and dedication. She is the key facilitator and visionary of the 11:11, a vast transformation doorway between duality and Oneness which is in effect between 1992 and 2011. <p>Solara travels widely throughout the world giving talks, workshops and planetary activations.

It&#39;s an unusually gruesome find, even for Fleshmarket Alley. When Inspector John Rebus is called to investigate, every fact he finds unleashes a host of new questions. Are the bones those of a mother and child? Are they actual human remains or fakes? Were they planted there - and if so, why?It could be nothing more than a ruthless and enterprising pub owner looking to create a local legend that will help lure trade. Or it could be something far worse - something as grisly as the death of a recent immigrant found brutally murdered at a local housing project, or the murder of Donald Cruikshank, a recently paroled rapist whose body is found just as a young woman goes missing. The missing girl is a friend of Inspector Rebus&#39;s colleague Detective Siobhan Clarke, and Siobhan is shocked to find herself in the same intricate web of murderers as Rebus - all somehow tied to that pile of bones under Fleshmarket Alley.In a race to stop the killings before more bodies turn up - even as the possibility of romantic entanglements distracts and entices them - Rebus and Siobhan plumb the darkest corners of their beloved city and confront the lawless, conscienceless men who dwell there. Writing with the unstoppable narrative force that has made him one of the bestselling writers in the world, Edgar Award-winner Ian Rankin delivers his most explosive and surprising mystery yet.</p><p>Ian Rankin is a #1 international bestselling author. Winner of an Edgar Award and the recipient of a Gold Dagger for fiction and the Chandler-Fulbright Award, he lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.In Rankin's most recent Scottish police procedural, DI John Rebus and DS Siobhan Clark investigate a murder in Edinburgh's Fleshmarket Alley. The story visits the city's seediest, most dangerous places and explores a modern fleshmarket, namely the trafficking of human beings. In spite of the length and expanding plot lines, Michael Page maintains the listener's interest and keeps us informed of the shifting story line. He also excels with voices, offering a range of believable British accents, as well as the accents of assorted immigrants, including Senegalese French. As always, Page delivers a sensitive reading of female voices, which isn't easy for male narrators. A very professional job.

Borneman is the author of <em>Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land</em>, <em>1812: The War That Forged a Nation</em>, and several books on the history of the western United States. He lives in Colorado.</p>The last American frontier, Alaska packs into 615,230 square miles the American saga of explorers and hunters, followed first by miners and soldiers, then homesteaders and tourists making their way into the wilderness. Borneman, a historian and lawyer who has produced multimedia programs for National Geographic, is at his best when he writes about these heroes who battled treacherous weather and terrain. At the same time, he stages their adventures against the backdrop of military and political events. Though some newspapers derided Lincoln's secretary of state, William Seward, for purchasing the territory as a strategic outpost in 1867, his decision proved prescient during WWII, when Alaska proved useful in patrolling the northern Pacific, and especially during the Cold War, when it allowed us to keep watch over communist countries in Asia. Until it obtained statehood in 1959, however, Alaska remained a colonial possession where the U.S. government controlled access to natural resources on the land, in the water and under the surface. Even now, 41% of the state belongs to national reserves; and the controversies continue among conservationists, fisheries, and timber and oil companies. The chapters on Alaska's environment demonstrate the balance of textbook history and storytelling that makes this informative book so readable. On occasion, Borneman becomes mired in local history, such as the quarrel over the state capital, when he might have instead devoted these pages to the Natives, whom he leaves hovering in the background until they suddenly leap forward as activists in the 1960s. He might also have included illustrations. Mirroring the Alaskan landscape, the book's scale and blocks of unbroken text can be daunting. 10 maps.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All But My Life: A Memoir</h2><p>"All But My Life" is the unforgettable story of Gerda Weissmann Klein's six-year ordeal as a victim of Nazi cruelty. From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops--including the man who was to become her husband--in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. <br>Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of "all but her life." By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. <br>Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda's beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century's terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome. <br></p><p>Gerda Weissmann Klein was born in Bielsko, Poland, in 1924, and now lives in Arizona with her husband, Kurt Klein, who as a U.S. Army lieutenant liberated Weissmann on May 7, 1945. The author of five books, she has received many awards and honorary degrees and has lectured throughout the country for the past forty-five years. <i>One Survivor Remembers </i>(a production of Home Box Office and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum), winner of an Emmy Award and the Academy Award for documentary short subject, was based on <i>All But My Life. </i>She will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in early 2011.<br>All But My Life<br>Part OneChapter 1THERE IS A WATCH LYING ON THE GREEN CARPET OF THE LIVING room of my childhood. The hands seem to stand motionless at 9:10, freezing time when it happened. There would be a past only, the future uncertain, time had stopped for the present. Morning-9:10. That is all I am able to grasp. The hands of the watch are cruel. Slowly they blur into its face.I lift my eyes to the window. Everything looks unfamiliar, as in a dream. Several motorcycles roar down the street. The cyclists wear green-gray uniforms and I hear voices. First a few, and then many, shouting something that is impossible and unreal. "Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!" And the watch says 9:10. I did not know then that an invisible curtain had parted and that I walked on an unseen stage to play a part in a tragedy that was to last six years.It was September 3, 1939, Sunday morning. We had spent a sleepless night in the damp, chilly basement of our house while the shells and bombs fell. At one point in the evening when Papa, Mama, my brother Arthur, then nineteen, were huddled in bewildered silence, my cat Schmutzi began to meow outside in the garden and Arthur stepped outside to let her in. He had come back with a bullet hole in his trousers."A bullet?""There is shooting from the roofs, the Germans are coming!"Then, in the early gray of the morning we heard the loud rumbling of enemy tanks. Our troops were retreating from the border to Krakow, where they would make their stand. Their faces were haggard, drawn, and unshaven, and in their eyes there was panic and defeat. They had seen the enemy, had tried and failed. It had all happened so fast. Two daysbefore, on Friday morning, the first of September, the drone of a great many German planes had brought most of the people of our little town into the streets. The radio was blasting the news that the Germans had crossed our frontier at Cieszyn and that we were at war! Hastily, roadblocks had been erected. Hysteria swept over the people and large numbers left town that day.I had never seen Bielitz, my home town, frightened. It had always been so safe and secure. Nestled at the foot of the Beskide mountain range, the high peaks had seemed to shelter the gay, sparkling little town from intruders. Bielitz was charming and not without reason was it called "Little Vienna." Having been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before 1919, it still retained the flavor of that era. Almost all of Bielitz' inhabitants were bilingual; Polish as well as German was spoken in the stores. In the center of the city, among carefully tended flower beds, stood its small but excellent theater, and next to it the Schloss, the castle of the Sulkowskys, the nobility closely linked to the Imperial Hapsburgs.Nothing in my lifetime had ever disturbed the tranquility of Bielitz. Only now, when I saw people deserting it, did I realize how close, dangerously close we were to the Czechoslovakian frontier; only twenty-odd miles separated us from Cieszyn.There had been talk of war for many weeks, of course, but since mid-August our family had been preoccupied with Papa's illness. Mama and I had been away in Krynica, a summer resort, from early June until the middle of August. Papa and Arthur had been unable to accompany us, and we returned when we received a telegram from Papa, suggesting we come home because of the gravity of the international situation. It had been somewhat of a shock to see how ill Papa looked when he met us at the station. His right arm was bothering him and Mama, alarmed, had called the doctor. The doctor diagnosed the illness as a mild heart attack and Papa was put to bed immediately.The following day two specialists were summoned to Papa's bedside. That same day we received a cable from Mama'sbrother Leo, who was in Turkey. It read: "Poland's last hour has come. Dangerous for Jews to remain. Your visas waiting at Warsaw embassy. Urge you to come immediately."Mama stuck the cable in her apron pocket, saying, "Papa is ill, that is our prime concern."Papa was to be spared excitement and worry at all costs, and visitors were cautioned not to mention the possibility of war to him. Mama little realized the fate we all might have been spared had she not concealed the truth from Papa. Yet on Friday morning, September 1, when German planes roared through the sky, Papa, who had been ill for two weeks, came face to face with reality. It was a tense day. I spent most of it in my parents' bedroom and instinctively stayed close to Papa.As that first day drew to a close, nobody touched supper, no one seemed to want to go to sleep. Mama sat in a chair near Papa's bed, Arthur and I watched from the window. Horses and wagons loaded with refugees continued to roll toward the East. Here and there a rocket, like blood spouting from the wounded earth, shot into the evening sky, bathing the valley in a grotesque red. I looked at my parents. Papa appeared strange, almost lifeless. The yellow flowers on Mama's black housecoat seemed to be burning. Outside, the mountain tops were ablaze for a moment, then they resounded with a thunderous blast that made the glass in the windows rattle like teeth in a skeleton's head. Everything was burning now. I looked at Mama again. Her soft, wavy, blue-black hair clung to her face. Her large, dark eyes seemed bottomless against her pale skin. Her mobile mouth was still and alien. The red glow was reflected in each of our faces. It made hers seem strange and unfamiliar. There was Mama, burning with the strange fire of destruction, and in the street the horses and wagons, the carts and bicycles were rolling toward the unknown. There was a man carrying a goat on his back, apparently the only possession he had. On the corner several mothers were clutching their infants to their breasts, and near them an old peasant woman crossed herself. It was as if the world had come to an end in that strange red light. Then, all of a sudden, Papa spoke to me."Go, call the family and find out what they are doing."I went downstairs. I sat down next to the phone with a long list of numbers. I started at the top and worked to the bottom, but there were no answers. The telephones kept ringing and ringing. I pictured the homes that I knew so well, and with each ring a familiar object or piece of furniture seemed to tumble to the floor.I became panicky. It seemed as though we were alone in a world of the dead. I went back upstairs. My parents and Arthur apparently had been talking. They stopped abruptly."Nobody answered, isn't that right?" Papa asked. I could not speak. I nodded. There was no longer any pretense. Papa motioned me to sit down on his bed. He embraced me with his left arm."Children," he said, "the time has come when I have to say what I hoped I would never have to say. I remember as if it were yesterday the cries of the wounded and the pale faces of the dead from the last war. I didn't think it possible that the world would come to this again. You believed I could always find a solution for everything. Yet I have failed you. I feel you children should go. Mama just told me that Mr. and Mrs. Ebersohn have asked to take you with them to look for refuge in the interior of Poland. I am sick when you most need my strength. I want you to go, children. I command you to go! His voice had assumed a tone of authority that I had never heard before. I saw Arthur look up startled at the mention of his girl friend's parents. More than ever he looked like Mama, but somehow he reminded me of Papa as he stood there tall, erect, and determined.Almost without hesitation, he said, "No! We are going to stay together."My parents' eyes met. I had a feeling there was relief and pride in their faces."I hoped you would say that," Papa said brokenly, "not for my sake, but because I hate to cast out my children to complete uncertainty. I believe that God will keep us together and under the roof of our house."He dropped back exhausted on his pillows. The effort hadbeen too much for him, and sudden stillness fell over the room. Strangely, all sound ceased outside as well and we noted that the sky was no longer red.&nbsp;<br>When I awoke the next morning everything was as peaceful as ever. The sun shone so brightly in my room. The fall flowers in our garden were in full bloom. The trees were laden with fruit. In my room everything was as it had always been, and what's more, even Papa was out of bed. His arm was in a sling, but he was up, and it seemed so wonderful I was sure the night before had all been a nightmare. No, not quite, because in my parents' faces I could read something that hadn't been there yesterday.When we met downstairs for breakfast everybody seemed cheerful. Papa was joking. Mama joined in this seemingly carefree banter. The maid had left to be with her relatives. Papa jokingly asked me whether I wanted the job. Nobody mentioned the war. I walked to the radio and turned it on. There was a sharp click, but no sound. I tried the phone, the lights, but all electricity was off. In a way that was good. There was no contact with the outside world. It was a wonderful, peaceful Saturday. But evening brought fury to the end of that last peaceful day. Sporadic shooting started from the rooftops, an attempt at delaying the enemy while our army retreated to Krakow. We looked for shelter in our cellar and sat there through the night. Toward morning the shooting stopped altogether and the vehicles of the Polish army ceased to roll. We came up from the cellar for a cup of tea in the living room. As I sat down on the couch near the window I could see the people outside in an obviously gay and festive mood, talking and laughing, carrying flowers, and everywhere the clicking of cameras."Mama, look," Arthur said. "Do you suppose-?" and he broke in the middle of the sentence, not daring to say what seemed impossible."No," Mama answered, and then Arthur pulled his watch out of his pocket, the roar of a motorcycle broke the stillness of our home, and his watch fell to the floor. It was 9:10 A.M.I looked out again. A swastika was flying from the house across the street. My God! They seemed prepared. All but us, they knew.A big truck filled with German soldiers was parked across the street. Our neighbors were serving them wine and cakes, and screaming as though drunk with joy, "Heil Hitler! Long live the F�hrer! We thank thee for our liberation!"I couldn't understand it. I didn't seem to be able to grasp the reality of what had happened. What are those people doing? The same people I had known all my life. They have betrayed us.The breakfast tea turned cold on the table. Papa and Mama looked down at the floor. Their faces were blank. Papa seemed so old, so gray. He had changed so much.I smelled something burning. A hot coal from the big green tile oven had fallen through the grill onto the carpet. I remembered a similar accident a year or two before and Mama had been terribly upset. Afterward she had turned the carpet so that the burned spot was under the couch. This time I wanted to shout a warning, but my throat froze when I saw my parents staring at that coal. They saw the carpet burn slowly, but they didn't seem to care. Finally, Papa got up and with his shoe carelessly shoved the coal back to the grill. Nobody spoke.I looked out the window and there was Trude, a girl I had known since childhood. She and her grandmother lived rent free in a two-room apartment in our basement in return for laundry service. Now I saw her carrying flowers from our garden, white roses of which we had been so proud because they bloomed out of season. She handed them to a soldier, breaking her tongue with the unfamiliar German, "Heil Hitler!" The soldier reached for the flowers, but somebody offered him some schnapps. He took the glass instead, the flowers tumbled to the dusty road, the boots of the soldiers trampled on them. I started sobbing, crying, releasing all my emotions and anxieties in that outburst. Arthur jumped over to me, put his hand over my mouth. "Are you crazy? Do you want to give us away?" But I did not hear him. The tears felt so good. He finally slapped me. "Think of Papa's life. Ifthey hear you crying-" I couldn't stop. He pulled me down from the couch, dragged me over the carpet, and up the stairs with Mama holding my mouth. They put me to bed, where I cried into the pillow until, exhausted, I fell asleep.Early in the afternoon the drunken, jubilant mob was still celebrating its "liberation" and hoarsely shouting "Heil Hitler." Papa and Mama smiled. Their smiles seemed more painful to me than my screams and tears, and I learned at that moment that I must not always cry when I wanted. I realized that we were outsiders, strangers in our own home, at the mercy of those who until then had been our friends. Although I was only fifteen I had a strong feeling, more instinct than reason, that our lives were no longer our own, but lay in the hands of a deadly enemy.Mama tried to maintain the pattern of our life, even on that fateful Sunday. She prepared dinner and we sat down as usual, but no one could eat and when the food was cleared away we sat in silence. Arthur got out books about the war of 1914 and looked up data about its development, but Papa said, "This is a different war. This one cannot possibly last four years. Four weeks, perhaps four months at most."Early in the evening, when the shouting of the drunken mob had died away, there was a knock at the door and a whispered, "Mrs. Weissmann." It was our neighbor Mrs. Bergmann, the mother of my friend Escia. She looked pale and shaken as she relayed the news that during the afternoon several Jews had been rounded up in the streets, locked in the Temple, and the Temple set on fire."Men had better stay out of sight," she whispered.Papa and Arthur exchanged glances. Mama's eyes widened and she pressed her lips together. But Mrs. Bergmann told us too that England and France had declared war on Germany that morning. She stayed only a few minutes. When she rose to leave, Mama saw her to the door and I followed them. Before they opened the door Mrs. Bergmann and Mama listened a while, then finally Mrs. Bergmann turned the knob and through a tiny opening glanced up and down the street before she slipped out.We sat a while longer in silence, none of us wanting to go to bed. That was the first evening in my life that I saw Mama without needlework in her hands. She just sat and stared into the fire. After a while she got up, outwardly calm and regal, and said, "Go to bed, children. We all will need rest and strength."Her words climaxed the first day under German rule.&nbsp;<br>The next morning, I was in the kitchen with Mama when Mrs. R�sche, one of the neighbors, came in with another woman and asked for our Polish flag."The flag?" Mama asked. "What for?""To make a German one, of course. It's really simple. You leave the red stripe as it is, cut a circle out of the white, and put a black swastika on it."Mama grew pale. At first she looked for our flag in places where she knew she wouldn't find it. Finally she brought it forth, knowing that she would have to sooner or later. Mrs. R�sche asked if Mama happened to have some black ribbon. She said she didn't. The other neighbor produced a piece. She told us it was good ribbon-that it would last for many years!Those two neighbors spent all morning sewing a Nazi flag to hang from our house....</p><h2>Before the Year Dot</h2><p>At sixteen I was very interested in palmistry.

Things were hardly Home Sweet Home: There was a branch down in the scrubby hedge that ran under the bay window. The lawn was scruffy. Weeds had sprouted in the gutters, reaching for the sun so high above.</p><p>The front door was locked, so he cupped his hands and looked into the windows on either side. Dust bunnies. Mismatched furniture. Sagging drapes.</p><p>There was a cheapo tin mailbox screwed into the bricks, and he opened the top. Circulars. A coupon book addressed to &#x201c;Occupant.&#x201d; No bills, credit card applications, letters. The only other piece of mail was an AARP magazine that had the same name as that of the driver&#x2019;s license he&#x2019;d been given.</p><p>Matthias rolled the mag up, shoved it into his wind-breaker, and headed back to the cab. Not only was this not his residence, nobody lived here. Best guess was that the person had died within, say, four to six weeks&#x2014;long enough so that the family had cleaned up the accounts payable issues, but before they emptied the place out to put it on the market.</p><p>Getting into the cab, he stared straight ahead.</p><p>&#x201c;Where to now?&#x201d;</p><p>With a groan, Matthias shifted over and got out his wallet. Sliding Mels Carmichael&#x2019;s business card free, he was struck by an overriding conviction that he shouldn&#x2019;t involve the woman.</p><p>Too dangerous.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ll it be, pal?&#x201d;</p><p>But shit, he had to start somewhere. And his brain was like an Internet connection gone bad.</p><p>&#x201c;Trade Street,&#x201d; he gritted.</p><p>As they headed for the downtown area and got caught in a net of traffic, he stared into the other cars and saw people drinking coffee, talking to passengers, stopping at red lights, going on green. Totally foreign to him, he thought. The kind of life where you nine-to-five&#x2019;d your way into a grave at the age of seventy-two was not how he&#x2019;d lived.</p><p>So what was, he asked his dumb-ass gray matter. What the fuck was?</p><p>All he got back was a headache while he strained for an answer.</p><p>As the <i>Caldwell Courier Journal</i> facility came into view, he took out one of the ten twenties in the wallet. &#x201c;Keep the change.&#x201d;</p><p>The cabdriver seemed more than happy to get rid of him.</p><p>Taking up res on the periphery of the front doors, Matthias loitered in the sunshine, being careful not to meet any stares&#x2014;and there were a lot of them: For some reason, he tended to attract attention, usually from women&#x2014;then again, the Florence Nightingale stuff was something the fairer sex was known for, and he did have scars on his face.</p><p>Ooooooh, romantic.</p><p>Eventually, he took cover across the street at the bus stop, parking it on the hard plastic bench and breathing in the secondhand smoke from people impatient for their public trans to arrive. The waiting didn&#x2019;t bother him. It was as if he were used to lurking, and to pass the time he played a game, memorizing the faces of the people who came and went out of the CCJ offices.</p><p>He was extremely good at it. One look was all it took, and he had the person in his database.</p><p>At least his short-term memory was working&#x2014;</p><p>The double doors pushed wide, and there she was.</p><p>Matthias sat up straighter as the sunlight hit her hair and all kinds of copper showed. Mels Carmichael, associate reporter, was with a heavyset guy who had to hitch his khakis up higher around his hips before they hit the steps. The two appeared to be arguing back and forth about something in the way friends did, and when Mels smiled, it appeared as if she had won whatever debate&#x2014;</p><p>Like she knew he was watching, she glanced across the street, and stopped dead. Touching her buddy on the sleeve, she said something, and then parted ways with the man, cutting through the traffic, coming over.</p><p>Matthias plugged his cane into the pavement, and tugged his rags into place as he stood. He had no idea why he wanted to look better for her, but he did&#x2014;then again, hard to look worse. His clothes weren&#x2019;t his, his cologne was Eau d&#x2019;Hospital Soap, and he&#x2019;d washed his hair with the antibacterial stuff because that was all he&#x2019;d had.</p><p>Naturally, his bad eye, that ugly, ruined thing, was what she looked at first. How could she not?</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Man, she looked great in her normal everyday clothes, those slacks and that wool jacket and the cream scarf she wore loose around her neck looking runway fine, as far as he was concerned.</p><p>Still no wedding ring.</p><p>Good, he thought for no apparent reason.</p><p>Shifting his gaze to the right, so maybe his defect wouldn&#x2019;t be so obvious, he returned the &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>Well, shit, now what. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stalking you, I swear.&#x201d; Liar. &#x201c;And I would have called, but I&#x2019;ve got no phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Do you need something? The police called me this morning with a follow-up, and I think they were still planning on speaking with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; He let that one stand where it was. &#x201c;Listen, I?.?.?.&#x201d;</p><p>The fact that he was leaving a sentence hanging seemed very unnatural, but his brain just wasn&#x2019;t producing.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit down,&#x201d; she said, gesturing to the seat. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe they let you out.&#x201d;</p><p>At that moment, a bus showed up, rumbling to a halt and blocking the sun, its hot diesel breath making him cough. As the pair of them settled on the bench, they kept quiet while the kibitzers filed on their ride.</p><p>When the bus kept going, the sunlight reappeared, bathing her in a yellow light.</p><p>For some stupid reason, his eyes started blinking hard.</p><p>&#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; she asked softly. &#x201c;Are you in pain?&#x201d;</p><p>Yes. But it wasn&#x2019;t physical. And it got worse whenever he looked at her. &#x201c;How do you know I need help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing your memory didn&#x2019;t magically come back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it hasn&#x2019;t. But that&#x2019;s not your fault.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I hit you. So I owe you.&#x201d;</p><p>He made a motion to his lower body. &#x201c;I was like this before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you remember anything? Prior to the accident, I mean.&#x201d; As he shook his head, she murmured, &#x201c;A lot of servicemen have come back in your condition.&#x201d;</p><p>Ah...as in Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, he thought. And part of that fit. The government...yes, he&#x2019;d had something to do with the Department of Defense, or national security...or...</p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t a Wounded Warrior. Because he hadn&#x2019;t been a hero.</p><p>&#x201c;They found my wallet,&#x201d; he blurted.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;</p><p>For some reason he gave it to her.</p><p>As she opened the thing and looked at the driver&#x2019;s license, she nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;</p><p>Focusing on the <i>Caldwell Courier Journal</i> emblem that hung over the door she&#x2019;d walked out of, he said, &#x201c;Look, all this is off the record, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I wish I had another option. I wish...I don&#x2019;t want to get you in trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t asked me to do anything yet.&#x201d; She stared at him. &#x201c;What do you have in mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you find out who that is?&#x201d; He pointed to the driver&#x2019;s license. &#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s not me.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Idaho: A Novel</h2><p><b>A stunning debut novel about love and forgiveness, about the violence of memory and the equal violence of its loss&#x2014;from O.

She graduated from the University of Montana and received an MA in English from the University of New Brunswick, Canada, and an MFA from the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop.

Henry Award for her story &#x201c;Owl.&#x201d;2004<br><br>They never drove the truck, except once or twice a year to get firewood. It was parked just up the hill in front of the woodshed, where it collected rain in the deep dents on the hood and mosquito larvae in the rainwater. That was the way it was when Wade was married to Jenny, and that&#x2019;s the way it is now that he is married to Ann.<br><br>Ann goes up there sometimes to sit in the truck. She waits until Wade is busy, so that he won&#x2019;t notice that she&#x2019;s gone. Today, she comes here under the pretense of getting firewood, dragging a blue sled over the mud and grass and patches of snow. The woodshed isn&#x2019;t far from the house, but it&#x2019;s hidden from view by a stand of ponderosa pines. She feels like she is trespassing, like none of this is hers to see.<br><br>The truck is parked on a rare space of flat land, an unlikely shelf carved into the mountainside. In front of the woodshed, around the truck, a few loose bricks lie here and there in the grass and snow. Spindles of mangled wire lean against the trees. Hanging from a long larch limb are two thick ropes that sway opposite each other now, but look as if they might have once been connected by a flat board&#x2014;�a child&#x2019;s swing.<br><br>It is March, sunny and cold. Ann gets into the driver&#x2019;s seat and shuts the door quietly. She pulls the seatbelt across her body, then rolls the window down so that several droplets splatter on her lap. She touches the wet spots with her fingertip, connecting them with lines in her mind to make a picture on her thigh. The picture reminds her of a mouse, or at least a child&#x2019;s drawing of a mouse, with a triangle face and a long, curlicued tail. Nine years ago, when Wade was still married to Jenny and both of his daughters were still alive, a mouse had crawled along the top of the truck&#x2019;s exhaust pipe into the engine compartment, and built its nest on the manifold. She thinks of how strange it is that Wade probably remembers that mouse, remembers the sound of it skittering under the hood, and yet he&#x2019;s forgotten his first wife&#x2019;s name. Or so it seems sometimes. But the mouse&#x2014;�the mouse is still very much alive in his memory.<br><br>A few years after Ann and Wade married, Ann found a pair of deerskin gloves in a toolbox high on a shelf in a closet. They were much nicer than the work gloves Wade usually wore, and seemed to be brand new except for the odor of something burned. That was how she learned about the mouse in the first place. She asked why he kept the gloves stored in their closet instead of using them. Wade told her that he wanted to preserve the smell.<br><br>What smell is that?<br><br>The smell of a rodent&#x2019;s nest that caught on fire.<br><br>The last smell in his daughter&#x2019;s hair.<br><br>It was a long time ago now that he said things like that. He stopped talking about the details of his daughter&#x2019;s death once he saw how much Ann held on to them. He probably thinks she&#x2019;s forgotten about the gloves, it&#x2019;s been so many years. But she hasn&#x2019;t. He keeps them in the filing cabinet with his papers, in his office upstairs. She has opened the drawer just enough to see them.<br><br>That mouse had probably been in the truck the whole winter, during that last year that Wade was married to Jenny, that last year that May was alive and June was safe. Ann thinks of the mouse going back and forth in the snow between the truck and the barn, hauling mouthfuls of hay or insulation or tufts of stuffing from the dogs&#x2019; beds, making its nest bigger and having babies in it once spring arrived. Some of the babies probably died early on and were absorbed by the nest, their tiny bones like shards of straw themselves. And other mice came, too; you could hear them moving under the hood if you put your ear against it. The little girls liked doing that.<br><br>Well, at least Ann imagines they did.<br><br>One day in August, the whole family got into the truck. Wade at the steering wheel, where Ann is sitting now, Jenny next to him, their daughters, June and May, nine and six, crammed in back with a jug of lemonade and Styrofoam cups, which they carved pictures into with their fingernails. The girls probably wanted to ride in the truck bed, but their mother would have said it was not safe on the highway. So they sat facing each other in the cab with their backs against the windows, bumping their knees, probably fighting.<br><br>They forgot all about the mice. They didn&#x2019;t notice anything at first, driving slowly over the dirt roads. But once they reached the highway in their town of Ponderosa, a smell like decay and burning hair, skin and seeds sizzling on a hot engine, entered through the vent and filled the whole cab of the truck until the little girls were gagging and laughing and pushing their freckled noses out their windows.<br><br>They had to drive on with their windows down, tolerating the smell, for the hour drive through the Nez Valley, past Athol and Careywood, then up the long road nearly to the top of Loeil, the mountain where the birch wood was already cut and piled, ready to be loaded. Their hair and clothes, and Wade&#x2019;s gloves, held the burned smell in their fibers. Ann pictures June and May. They wait in the sun while their mother rolls the birch logs onto the truck bed and their father stacks them there. The girls lean against the tires, slapping horseflies on their legs, pouring lemonade into the dust.<br><br>The smell would have been there on the way back, too. It is the one constant. It connects two things in Ann&#x2019;s mind that she can&#x2019;t manage to connect otherwise&#x2014;�the drive up the mountain and the drive back down. The drive back down is the part Ann comes here to try to understand.<br><br>There would have been things Wade had to consider, before he could take control and go for help. Practical things. Shutting the tailgate, for example, so the logs wouldn&#x2019;t roll out. He would have had to remember to hold the handle up and then push in&#x2014;�there was a trick to it&#x2014;�in order to lock the tailgate. That he would remember, that his fingers could do what they were supposed to do even in the midst of his horror, has something to do with the reason Ann loves him. One day, perhaps, everything will be gone from his mind except the trick of the tailgate latch, and Ann will love him still.<br><br>She thinks of how easy it would have been to get lost on the way back down, since they&#x2019;d gotten lost so badly on the way up. How could anything have looked familiar? The narrow, grassy roads. The crudely made road signs nailed to trees: That he had read them an hour before seemed impossible to her. All of it seemed impossible. The summer sky, the snapping of twigs under the truck&#x2019;s tires. The smell of grease and honeysuckle. Jenny&#x2019;s breath fogging the window.<br><br>Ann has had to imagine most of it, everything beyond the facts Wade told her or she heard on TV. She did try very hard during those early days to keep the radio and TV off, so that everything she knew she knew from Wade. What Wade wanted to tell her, she would keep. But she wouldn&#x2019;t let herself go searching; she wouldn&#x2019;t let herself ask.<br><br>But all of that is different now that Wade is forgetting. She wants to ask him if he and Jenny spoke, before his memory is lost for good. Did Jenny look out the side window or straight ahead? Or did she look at him?<br><br>At what point did he rip down the rearview mirror?<br><br>No, Ann thinks, it isn&#x2019;t even the drive back. It is his getting into the truck at all. Opening the door and getting in. Jenny there with the cup of lemonade shaking in her hand&#x2014;�or maybe not shaking, maybe perfectly still. Maybe the cup empty. Maybe the lemonade spilled on her lap like the droplets of water now on Ann&#x2019;s thigh, in the shape of something harmless, something that the child in the backseat might have drawn.<br><br>Ann runs her hand over the dashboard and the soft, moist pollen of last summer sticks to her palm. It is all put together for her, here. The rearview mirror is up again, glued in place, and there&#x2019;s a dream catcher thrown around it, with two fluorescent feathers hanging down. The carpet has been shampooed, the right backseat replaced entirely, with one that looks like the original on the left, only a brighter shade of blue and missing the little holes where the stuffing came out and where the girls might have once stuck their fingers.<br><br>Ann turns the key to let the engine run while she sits here. She breathes deeply. Nine years and the smell of the mouse&#x2019;s nest is gone, but every now and then, when she shifts in the driver&#x2019;s seat and the dust rises from the cushions, she catches what might be the hint of that old smell, distant and thinly sweet, leather and burning grass.<br><br>Though of course it could also be the controlled spring fires down in the valley fields, far away.<br><br>&#x25a0;<br><br>Ann and Wade have been married for eight years. She is thirty-�eight now, and Wade is fifty.<br><br>Last year, Ann found a box of Wade&#x2019;s old shirts in the attic. She brought the box downstairs and sat on her knees in a warm square of sunlight on the floor. She unfolded the shirts one at a time, held each one up, and placed some in a pile for the Salvation Army and some in a pile to keep.<br><br>Wade walked into the bedroom and saw her doing this.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this too small?&#x201d; she said. She didn&#x2019;t turn around because she was trying to decide about an oil stain. She was holding the shirt up above her, to see the light shine through it.<br><br>Wade didn&#x2019;t answer. She thought he hadn&#x2019;t heard. She folded the shirt and moved on.<br><br>But the next thing she knew, Wade was pushing her head down, pushing it hard, into the box of clothes. She was so shocked that at first she laughed. But he didn&#x2019;t stop. The cardboard edge rubbed against her throat, and her laugh became a gasp for air and then a scream. She clawed at his legs, thrashing blindly. She pounded her fists on his shoes, jammed her elbows into his knees. He was speaking to her in a voice she recognized&#x2014;�she couldn&#x2019;t think from where&#x2014;�but it was not a voice he&#x2019;d ever used with her. &#x201c;No! No!&#x201d;&#x2014;�almost a growl.<br><br>His dogs. He used that voice to train the dogs.<br><br>Then he let her go. He stepped back. She lifted her head, slowly, with caution. He sighed deeply, then he touched her shoulder as if to ask for her forgiveness, or&#x2014;�this occurred to her even in her shock&#x2014;�to offer forgiveness to her. After a minute, he asked her if she&#x2019;d seen his mowing shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, staring into the box of clothes. She sat on her knees, shaking, smoothing down the static in her hair, over and over again, as if that would make a difference. Wade found his shoes, put them on, went outside. In a few minutes, she heard the tractor. Wade was clearing the knapweed from the pasture.<br><br>In the year leading up to the strange episode with the box of clothes, he had done other things that alarmed her. He made phone calls to his customers, accusing them of sending bad checks, even as Ann proved to him with bank statements that he was wrong. He threaded his bootlaces so that they tied at the bottom instead of the top. He purchased the same pair of pliers three times in one week. He threw her fresh loaf of bread, still sinking in its warmth, into the mulch bucket to feed the hens as if she had baked it for them. Once, in the last week of January, he cut a beautiful white pine and dragged it a mile through the new snow. When he arrived in the yard where Ann was, he motioned to it, smiling. &#x201c;You think this is too tall?&#x201d;<br><br>A Christmas tree.<br><br>&#x201c;But Christmas&#x2014;� Wade, it was a month ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t remember?&#x201d; She laughed, horrified. &#x201c;Where do you think you got that coat you&#x2019;re wearing?&#x201d;<br><br>But the day he pushed her into the box of clothes was something very different; it was the only time his disease manifested itself in violence, violence so far removed from the man he was that Ann couldn&#x2019;t fathom such a thing happening even in the moments that immediately followed.<br><br>But after it happened once, it happened again. A few months later, he pushed her against the refrigerator, so that her cheek pressed against a coupon she&#x2019;d hung there, for a diner called Panhandler Pies. She fought him, but just like the first time, fighting only hurt her more. When he let her go, she pushed him away from her and screamed at him, but he just stood there sadly, as if disappointed in her.<br><br>Another day, not too long after that, Ann poured a bucket of pinecones onto the kitchen table. She intended to decorate them with peanut butter and birdseed, to hang on the tree limbs for the finches. But as soon as she sat down to work, she felt his hand on her head, and he pushed her down into the pinecones.<br><br>The pinecones left a rash of tiny cuts on her left cheek.<br><br>Later still, the wind blew open the door of one of his daughters&#x2019; old rooms. He thought it was Ann who had opened it. He pressed her forehead against the door once it was closed again, and told her, &#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; until she said, in her fear and shock, &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>She did not understand these things, but knew that Wade didn&#x2019;t understand them, either, and so she found no way to express her anger. No way to stop these episodes from happening again. The pain and the shock of them wore off the more they happened, and she began to bear the assaults because she didn&#x2019;t know what else she could do. She took note of what provoked him, and made sure never to do those things again. No more pinecones, no Panhandler Pies, no boxes of old clothes, no going in his daughters&#x2019; rooms. Simple enough. These things were a kind of collection she began to keep, a list she would run down in her mind, eventually not out of pain anymore but out of wonder, as if something were right there on the edge of her life, waiting for her to discover it. At night, when he was asleep, she thought about these things as she studied the face she loved. His pale eyelids stark on his sun-�roughed face. His lips chapped, his cheeks unshaven. Such inherent kindness in his body that it was impossible to picture this man doing the things he had certainly done. She touched her lips to his thick hair, and she closed her eyes, too.</p><h2>Little Saigon</h2><p>In Orange County, California, part-time journalist and semi-pro surfer Chuck Frye stumbles upon a trans-Pacific espionage network and uncovers a corrupt plot to topple the leadership of Vietnam</p><p>T. Jefferson Parker is the bestselling author of fourteen previous novels, including Storm Runners and The Fallen. Alongside Dick Francis and James Lee Burke, Parker is one of only three writers to be awarded the Edgar Award for Best Novel more than once. Parker lives with his family in Southern California.This workmanlike suspense thriller by the author of Laguna Heat takes its name from the populous Vietnamese community in California's Orange County, an intriguing although largely unexplored backdrop for the action. Chuck Frye, a surf bum who has recently failed at journalism, business and marriage, lives in the shadow of his war-hero brother Bennett, and their father, a wealthy real-estate tycoon. Bennett's Vietnamese wife is a singer whose protest music has made her a heroine among anticommunists and Asian expatriates. When she is kidnapped during a performance, Chuck joins the search for her, hoping to end his estrangement from the Frye clan. But the more he learns about the crime's motivepolitics, gang warfare or revenge are all possibilitiesthe more intently his family tries to shut him out of the investigation. Meanwhile, the body count continues to mount. Parker's methodical story moves briskly but permits few surprises, and his novel could do without a silly subplot about Chuck's personal redemption, which apparently lies not only in finding his sister-in-law but also in regaining the courage to ride a big wave after a surfing accident. 125,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Feet of Clay</h2><p>As autumn fogs hold Ankh-Morpok in their grip, the City Watch must find a murderer who can&#39;t be seen.

And on top of all this, the Watch have other problems to deal with, such as a werewolf suffering from Pre-Lunar Tension.</p><p>In <i>Feet of Clay</i>, Terry Pratchett continues the fantasy adventures on Discworld--where anything goes. Anything but murder, that is. Commander Vimes of the Watch must investigate a puzzling series of deaths, with help from various trolls and dwarfs. Pratchett's humor and excellent writing skills draw the reader effortlessly into his zany world. <i>Feet of Clay</i> is 19th in the series. <i>--Blaise Selby</i>Royalty is like dandelions. No matter how many heads you chop off, the roots are still there underground, waiting to spring up again. <p> A murderer is stalking Discworld: A prowling perp who leaves behind jaunty corpses and strange-smelling tracks of curious white clay -- a grim reaper who belongs to neither the Assassins' Guild nor the Thieves' Guild. </p><p> Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Guard is determined to stop this unauthorized assassin -- and to prove it, he has hired a Dwarf to help him. With the assistance of, Corporal Cheery Littlebottom, Vimes and his men (and trolls, and such) can get to the, well, bottom of anything. Even when one of the victims is murdered with a loaf of her own Battle Bread (available in convenient throwing slices, guerrilla crumpets, and defensive bagels). And even when the investigation leads to an out-of-work <i>golem</i>, a vampire dragon, and a vegetarian werewolf. </p><p> Such strangeness is perfectly normal in normally perfect Ankh-Morpork, the greatest of Discworld's cities, where anything can happen and therefore, naturally, always does. But when Vimes unravels a living (and, in fact, complaining) Coat-of-Arms and finds an unexpected royal clue, he is faced with a new dilemma. </p><p> Fighting crime is one thing. But what if winning means inflicting a new King on a city that does very well, thank you, with no King at all? </p><p> Whoever created humanity left in a major design flaw.

Emmaline sneaks a look, and finds that it's poetry! Inspired, Emmaline writes her own first poem and secretly deposits it on Emily's desk. Emily answers with another poem, and a lively exchange begins. In this charming and fanciful introduction to Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Spires demonstrates the power of poetry to express our deepest feelings, while Claire A. Nivola's delicate pencil drawings capture the intricacies of life in Emily's world. Included are eight of Dickinson's most loved poems, with seven corresponding poems by Emmaline that are sure to bring out the poet in any child.<br><br></p><p><i>"I am a mouse, a white mouse. My name is Emmaline. Before I met Emily, the great poet of Amherst, I was nothing more than a crumb gatherer, a cheese nibbler, a mouse-of-little-purpose. There was an emptiness in my life that nothing seemed to fill." </i><p> That is, until Emmaline the mouse takes up residence in the wall of 19th-century poet Emily Dickinson's room in Amherst, Massachusetts. Emmaline spends her days happily observing the reclusive poet: "She seemed to be everywhere and nowhere at once, fluttering through the house like a ghost, stirring up a batch of gingerbread in the kitchen, or walking in the garden, lost in a reverie." The mouse's life changes when a gust of wind blows one of Emily's poems her way. She blushes as she reads Emily's evocative words that so aptly capture her own feelings, and from then on is determined to be a poet herself. The exchange of poems between the two species of poet is truly marvelous, as eight of Emily Dickinson's poems are answered by seven of author Elizabeth Spires's (an award-winning poet herself). "I'm Nobody! Who are you? / Are you--Nobody--too? / Then there's a pair of us! / Don't tell! they'd banish us--you know!" is followed by Emmaline's "It matters what we think, / What words we put in ink, / It matters what we feel / What feelings we conceal." A near miss with the family cat, an unpleasant interlude with a thick-headed editor, and even a threatening stoat keep the story moving, but the real excitement lies in the deepening friendship between Emily and Emmaline... and in Spires's inventive portrayal of the process of self-expression and the power of words. Along the way, illustrator Claire A. Nivola's sweetly skritchy sketches reflect the shy demeanor of both Emily and Emmaline. A brief portrait of Emily Dickinson concludes the book, but readers will come away with a glimpse of the poet and her work that no biography could ever communicate.

Self-taught artisan Carlson raises the bar and concocts 21 personable creatures few will be able to resist. Even better are the marvelously detailed instructions, from the formation of hands, feet, and faces, to solving 21 common problems, such as crumbly clay and (horrors!) breakage. Though needed amounts of material and finished sizes are not included in the directions, very little is omitted in transforming a once humble material into very realistic beings: included are color photographs, clothing templates, explicit instructions about equipment and basic techniques, and other tips (e.g., prebake the eyeballs).

Because the clay is so easily worked, it is not difficult to make one's own figures to use in doll houses or other miniature settings.

My doctor says that, contrary to conventional wisdom, she doesn&#x2019;t believe our memories flag because of a drop in estrogen but because of how crowded it is in the drawers of our minds.

After discovering at a very young age that she possessed certain psychic gifts and the ability to make contact with spirits of the dead, she developed an intense interest in the world of the occult. In the summer of 1969 she was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older family member, and has since devoted her personal life and writing career to educating the public about the ways of the Craft.<br>As a teenager, Gerina Dunwich (using a different nom de plume at the time) began writing poetry, short stories, magazine articles, and stage plays complete with musical scores. Her first published newspaper article,&nbsp;<i>His Voice was His Vehicle,</i>&nbsp;was an interview with singer/songwriter Jim Peterik from the rock n&#x2019; roll group, the Ides of March (and later, Survivor). Co-written with her cousin, Barbara Williams, it was published in October 1976.<br>By the spring of 1980 Gerina Dunwich was publishing a small press literary journal called&nbsp;<i>Golden Isis,</i>&nbsp;a one-woman operation that specialized in Goddess-inspired poetry and offbeat fiction. Its international circulation grew to nearly 3600 and it attracted subscribers from places as far away as Puerto Rico, Australia, Italy, and Japan.&nbsp;<i>Circle of Shadows</i>&nbsp;- a collection of Gerina&#x2019;s own poetry, was self-published a decade later.<br>After visiting Salem, Massachusetts, in April of 1984, Gerina relocated to the North Shore of Boston, residing first in Beverly, and then in Ipswich. In the winter of 1986, she purchased the historic Moses Day Homestead - a stately 17th century Colonial house in Haverhill that had been built around the time of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials. The house, which had been featured in a local television documentary about haunted houses in the Boston area, was a hotbed of paranormal activity. Soon after moving there, Gerina experienced a vivid dream in which the spirit of the late witchcraft author Sybil Leek appeared and whispered to her that her destiny as an author was "written in the stars." The dream proved to be prophetic when, in 1987, Gerina landed her first book contract with Citadel Press. (Appropriately, the contract was dated October 31st.) The following year saw the publication of her first book,&nbsp;<i>Candlelight Spells,</i>&nbsp;and the start of her successful career as a prolific book author.<br>In December of 1993 she moved into a century-old Victorian mansion located in the quaint and historic town of Fort Covington, New York. She soon opened a small shop on High Street called "The Country Witch" (later renamed "The Calico Cat Whatnot Shop"), which sold antiques, curios and various occult supplies. (Coincidentally, the antique shop run by Sybil Leek in the New Forest was also located on a High Street.) The business proved to be instrumental in bringing together many of the area's Pagans, including several who would later become Gerina's close friends and members of her coven.<br>In February of 1998 Gerina Dunwich received a ministerial license from the Universal Life Church. Ironically, the first handfasting she performed as a legally ordained minister was for the younger brother of the cousin who had introduced her to witchcraft nearly thirty years earlier.<br>Gerina has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows throughout the United States and Canada. She has lectured and presented workshops at festivals and gatherings across the country, including the CraftWise Pagan Gathering (Waterbury, Connecticut), the Real Witches' Ball (Columbus, Ohio), and Panpipes' Pagan Day Festival (West Hollywood, California).<br>She is a member of the International Ghost Hunters Society, the Author&#x2019;s Guild, and the Fellowship of Isis. Her biography is listed in a number of reference works, such as&nbsp;<i>Who's Who in the East; Who&#x2019;s Who of American Women, Personalities of America;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Crossroads: Who's Who of the Magickal Community</i>&nbsp;(published by The Witching Well Education and Research Center, 1988). She is also mentioned in Anne Carson's&nbsp;<i>Goddesses and Wise Women,</i>&nbsp;Raymond Buckland&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Witch Book,</i>&nbsp;and other works.<br>In addition to being an occult author and respected spokesperson for the Neo-Pagan community, Gerina Dunwich is a freelance paranormal researcher who specializes in ghost animals and animal-related hauntings. In 2005 she founded the Paranormal Animal Research Group, which investigates haunted places and researches animal sensitivity to paranormal anomalies.</p><h2>Einstein&#39;s War: How Relativity Triumphed Amid the Vicious Nationalism of World War I</h2><p><b><b><i><br></i>"Stanley is a storyteller par excellence."--<i>The Washington Post<br>Kirkus Review&nbsp;</i>starred review;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;starred review;&nbsp;<i>Booklist&nbsp;</i>starred review<br><br>The birth of a world-changing idea in the middle of a bloodbath</b><br></b><i>Einstein&#x2019;s War</i> is a riveting exploration of both the beauty of scientific creativity and enduring horrors of human nature. These two great forces battle in a story that culminates with a victory now a century old, the mind-bending theory of general relativity. <br> &nbsp;<br> Few recognize how the Great War, the industrialized slaughter that bled Europe from 1914 to 1918, shaped Einstein&#x2019;s life and work. While Einstein never held a rifle, he formulated general relativity blockaded in Berlin, literally starving. He lost fifty pounds in three months, unable to communicate with his most important colleagues. Some of those colleagues fought against rabid nationalism; others were busy inventing chemical warfare&#x2014;being a scientist trapped you in the power plays of empire. Meanwhile, Einstein struggled to craft relativity and persuade the world that it was correct. This was, after all, the first complete revision of our conception of the universe since Isaac Newton, and its victory was far from sure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scientists seeking to confirm Einstein&#x2019;s ideas were arrested as spies. Technical journals were banned as enemy propaganda. Colleagues died in the trenches. Einstein was separated from his most crucial ally by barbed wire and U-boats. This ally was the Quaker astronomer and Cambridge don A. S. Eddington, who would go on to convince the world of the truth of relativity and the greatness of Einstein.<br> &nbsp;<br> In May of 1919, when Europe was still in chaos from the war, Eddington led a globe-spanning expedition to catch a fleeting solar eclipse for a rare opportunity to confirm Einstein&#x2019;s bold prediction that light has weight. It was the result of this expedition&#x2014;the proof of relativity, as many saw it&#x2014;that put Einstein on front pages around the world. Matthew Stanley&#x2019;s epic tale is a celebration of how bigotry and nationalism can be defeated and of what science can offer when they are.</p><p><b>Matthew Stanley</b> is a professor of the history of science at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

The bloody, seemingly endless conflict provoked everything he detested: violence, nationalism, and the herd-thinking that drove individuals into nothing. Matt Stanley gives us the scientist-philosopher and activist during these bloody years, tacking back and forth so effectively between the development of general relativity, plans to test it, and the lopsided battle Einstein fought with the majority of German intellectuals who lined up happily behind the battle lines.

It was bulky--perhaps three feet long and almost as high. The legend printed on it said it had originally contained a microwave oven manufactured by General Electric. Strips of brown tape had been wrapped erratically around it. It was a crude box, incongruous amid the pale pastels and tasteful artifacts of Catherine Perry's stylish office. </p><p>"How was the weekend?" Markie said. </p><p>Catherine Morris Perry hung her raincoat on its peg, hung her rain hat over it, removed the transparent plastic from her shoes, and said, "Hello, Markie." </p><p>"How was Vermont?" Markie asked. "Wet up there, too?" </p><p>"Where'd that come from?" Catherine said, indicating the box. </p><p>"Federal Express," Markie said. "I signed for it." </p><p>"Am I expecting anything?" </p><p>"Not that you told me about. How was Vermont?" </p><p>"Wet," Catherine said. She did not wish to discuss Vermont, or anything else involving life outside this office, with Markie Bailey. What she did wish to discuss with Markie was taste. Or lack of taste. Putting the big box, brown and ugly, on her antique desk, as Markie had done, was typical of the problem. It squatted there, ugly, obscenely out of place. As out of place as Mrs. Bailey was in this office. But getting rid of her would be almost impossible. Certainly a huge amount of trouble under federal civil service rules. Mrs. Perry's specialty in law was not personnel, but she had learned something from the efforts to get rid of Henry Highhawk, that troublemaking conservator in the Museum of Natural History. What an unending fiasco that had been. </p><p>"You had a call," Markie said. "The cultural attach�'s office at the Chilean embassy. He wanted an appointment." </p><p>"Later," Catherine Morris Perry said. "I'll return it later." She knew what that problem would be. Another Indian-giver problem. General Something-or-Other wanting artifacts returned. He claimed his great-grandfather had only loaned them to some big shot in United Fruit, and he had no right to give them to the Smithsonian, and they were national treasures and must be returned. Incan, as she remembered. Gold, of course. Gold masks, encrusted with jewels, and the general would probably decide they were the general's personal treasure, if he could get his hands on them. And seeing that he didn't meant a huge amount of work for her, research into documents and into international law, which she should get working on right away. </p><p>But there sat the box taking up desk space. It was addressed to her as "Museum Spokesperson." Catherine Morris Perry didn't like being addressed as "Spokesperson." That she was so addressed probably stemmed from the statement she'd given the <i>Washington Post</i> on museum policy. it had been more or less an accident, the whole thing. The reporter's call had been referred to her only because someone was sick in the public affairs office, and someone else was away from his desk, and whoever had handled the call had decided a lawyer should deal with it. It concerned Henry Highhawk again, obliquely at least. It concerned the trouble he was stirring up about returning aboriginal skeletal remains. And the <i>Post</i> had called and identified her incorrectly as spokesperson, and quoted her when they should have quoted the museum board of directors. The policy on skeletons was, after all, official policy of the board. And a sound policy. </p><p>The Federal Express shipping order attached to the box was correct except for the erroneous title. She was "Temporary Assistant Counsel, Public Affairs" on loan from the Department of the Interior. She sat and flipped quickly through the remainder of her mail. Nothing much. What was probably an invitation from the National Ballet Guild to an upcoming fund-raiser. Something from the American Civil Liberties Union. A memo from the museum maintenance director telling her why it was impossible for him to deal with a personnel complaint as the law required him to. Another letter concerning insurance for borrowed items going into an exhibit opening next month, and three letters which seemed to be from private outside sources, none familiar. </p><p>Catherine Morris Perry put all the envelopes aside unopened, looked at the box, and made a wry face. She opened her desk drawer and extracted her letter opener. Then she buzzed Mrs. Bailey. </p><p>"Yes'um." </p><p>"Mrs. Bailey. When packages arrive like this, don't bring them in and put them on my desk. Open them and get the contents out." </p><p>"Okay," Mrs. Bailey said. "I'll open it now. It's a heavy thing." She paused. "Mrs. Paterson always wanted all the mail put in on her desk." </p><p>"I'll open it," Catherine said. "I meant from now on. And Mrs. Paterson is on leave. She is not in charge now." </p><p>"Okay," Mrs. Bailey said. "Did you notice the telephone messages? Two of them? On your desk, there?" </p><p>"No," Catherine said. They were probably under the box. </p><p>"Dr. Hebert called and just said he wanted to congratulate you on the way you handled the skeleton thing. On what you said in the <i>Post."</i> </p><p>With her free hand Catherine Perry was slicing the tape away with the letter opener. She thought that this box was probably a result of that story in the <i>Washington Post.</i> Any time the museum got into the news, it reminded a thousand old ladies of things in the attic that should be saved for posterity. Since she was quoted, one of them had sent this trash to her by name. What would it be? A dusty old butter churn? A set of family albums? </p><p>"The other one was somebody in the anthropology division. I put her name on the slip. Wants you to call. Said it was about the Indians wanting their skeletons back." </p><p>"Right," Catherine said. She pulled open the top flaps. Under them was a copy of the <i>Washington Post,</i> folded to expose the story that had quoted her.</p></p><h2>The Doors: The Complete Illustrated Lyrics</h2><p>The complete lyrics of &#34;The Doors&#34;, illustrated with many photographs of the group.

Photos.</p><p><b>David Schneider</b> is an ordained Zen priest and the co-editor, with Kaz Tanahashi, of <i>Essential Zen.</i> He lives in K�ln, Germany, but he travels and teaches frequently in the U.S.Religious history rings with tales of converted libertines- -Saul, St. Augustine, Thomas Merton among them. Now, thanks to this wonderfully uplifting biography by freelance journalist Schneider, to that list can be added Issan Dorsey--the thieving, doping, female-impersonating gay hooker who became abbot of one of the nation's top Zen monasteries. Born Thomas Dorsey, Jr., in 1933, the future abbot bloomed into his homosexuality as a teenager and moved to San Francisco, where he developed a nightclub drag-queen act--and a world-class drug habit to go with it. Here, we learn much about Dorsey's life from his own mouth--Schneider interviewed Dorsey extensively, as well as his friends, for this account: ``I loved barbiturates...I'd take them by mouth, or melt them down and shoot them. If I had tracks, I'd just put makeup on them,'' says Dorsey, who hit bottom in the early 60's in Chicago while living and robbing with a hooker/stripper/thief named Bang Bang La Toure. When Dorsey moved back to San Francisco, though, he encountered LSD--and spun into a psychedelic, then spiritual, direction, eventually landing on a balcony overlooking meditators at the city's Zen Center. Dorsey decided to join them--and never looked back, devoting himself to two Zen masters, including the controversial Richard Baker (Schneider examines the Baker-Dorsey relationship as a provocative case study in the master-disciple dynamic). In time, Dorsey became abbot of the Castro district's Hartford Street Zen Center, and it's clear from the numerous testimonies here that his earlier life instilled in him an astonishing tolerance and compassion for all--a trait that inspired him to open the city's celebrated Maitri Hospice, for AIDS patients. Never fully embracing celibacy, Dorsey himself contracted AIDS, dying in 1990. Not hagiographic--Schneider emphasizes that Dorsey remained mercurial until the end--but, still, angels weep as the abbot, his body ravaged but his dignity aglow, breathes his final breath.

She&#39;s been busy designing ever since.The asymmetrical wrap has been having its day with knitters lately, but this collection of wraps by Hunter Hammersen is the first to really make me sit up and want to knit one (or several). <p> The combination of the shaping, the yarn, the stitch patterns and the design information make this my first favorite book of 2015. I had to look through the book several times to get to everything. First, I was captivated by the stitch patterns and yarns. Every wrap has a textural feeling, even the lace. The combination of yarns and stitch patterns are beautifully sculptural. </p><p> The photography and the design of the book are stunning. The images and colors are clear and crisp. I wanted to reach in and pet all of the shawls. </p><p> Most of the wraps are between a scarf and shawl with 40-48 inch wingspans and are built on a curly triangle shape. </p><p> There are 14 wraps in the book and my must-knits are Icterine, Infuscate and Filemot (the cover design). </p><p> Hunter Hammersen is such a generous clever designer and she explains the construction process of these shawls with such detail and clarity that it's easy to alter the wraps in the book or design your own. </p><p> This book is an example of independent craft publishing at its finest. --Jillian Moreno, editor of KnittySpin</p></p><h2>The Ascension Flame of Purification and Immortality</h2><p>This booklet of 64 pages contains simple but effective teachings about Ascension realization.

To the great Catholic powers of France and Spain, England was a heretic pariah state, a canker to be cut away for the health of the greater body of Christendom. Elizabeth's government, defending God's true Church of England and its leader, the queen, could stop at nothing to defend itself.</p><p>Headed by the brilliant, enigmatic, and widely feared Sir Francis Walsingham, the Elizabethan state deployed every dark art: spies, double agents, cryptography, and torture. Delving deeply into sixteenth-century archives, Stephen Alford offers a groundbreaking, chillingly vivid depiction of Elizabethan espionage, literally recovering it from the shadows. In his company we follow Her Majesty's agents through the streets of London and Rome, and into the dank cells of the Tower. We see the world as they saw it-ever unsure who could be trusted or when the fatal knock on their own door might come. <i>The Watchers </i>is a riveting exploration of loyalty, faith, betrayal, and deception with the highest possible stakes, in a world poised between the Middle Ages and modernity.</p></p><p>Stephen Alford is a fellow in history at King's College, Cambridge, and the author of the acclaimed <i>Burghley: William Cecil at the Court of Elizabeth I, The Early Elizabethan Polity: William Cecil and the British Succession Crisis, 1558-1569, </i>and <i>Kingship and Politics in the Reign of Edward VI</i>. He writes for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> and other periodicals.<p>&#x201c;The secret agents who labored to prove Mary's guilt and bring about her execution are the stars of this meticulous chronicle ...

Secret correspondence, infiltration into the ranks of exile English Catholics in Rome and the betrayal of double agents are some of the thrilling elements that comprise this little-known tale.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ilana Teitelbaum, Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>&#x201c;It provides a genuine--and compelling--reappraisal of one of the most studied periods in English history: the reign of Elizabeth I. In exploring the world (or underworld) of Elizabethan espionage, Alford takes us on a darker, more disturbing and arguably more fascinating journey through the Elizabethan era than any other historian of the period ...[An] engaging and perfectly pitched narrative. ...

They culminate in the period's best-known intelligence coup, the entrapment and execution of Mary Queen of Scots after the so-called Babington Plot, and Alford's account of this episode plays out as a piece of bleak cat-and-mouse reminiscent of le Carr� at his most disenchanted.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daily Telegraph (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Alford's gripping new book...brings these men, their worlds and the unfortunate victims of their espionage vividly out of the shadows.

Alford concludes that the government &#x2018;was absolutely right to believe the truths of plots and conspiracies and plans for invasion and assassinations'. However, they &#x2018;overestimated their enemies' intelligence, cunning and organisation'. What gave the struggle its venom was the context, the religious wars that ravaged 16th century Europe. If you want to know the inside story of that struggle, the dark heart of calculation and the fight for survival, then this is the book to read. I know no better.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Spectator (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Alford has written an exhilarating and well-researched history.

We see in vivid detail the whole succession of real and imagined Catholic plots against the queen. The result is an essential story, of how the leaders of the government increasingly became preoccupied with the need for espionage, to the point of obsession. And as Dr Alford observes: &#x2018;the more obsessively a state watches, the greater the dangers it perceives.' Anyone who thinks of Elizabeth's reign as a golden age untainted by shades of terror should read this book: a consummate blend of scholarship, storytelling that reveals the sinister under-edge of power.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ian Mortimer, author of Medieval Intrigue: Decoding Royal Conspiracies and The Time Traveler's Guide to Elizabethan England</i></p><p>&#x201c;An intimate and revealing exploration of the men who did the Elizabethan security state's dirty work. Lifting the lid on the Protestant-Catholic 'cold war' of the late sixteenth century, Stephen Alford sifts the sources with a forensic eye, bringing to life the motley collection of self-interested chancers and drifters, religious and political zealots who watched each other in the streets of London, Paris and Rome. Leading us into the dark corners, safe houses and interrogation chambers of this twilight world, <i>The Watchers</i> paints a fascinating picture of the vast and nebulous threat facing Elizabethan England - and its determination to deal with that threat by any means necessary.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas Penn, author of Winter King: Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England</i></p><p>&#x201c;The image of Elizabethan England is one of ruffs and lutes, of gentlemanly courtiers spreading velvet cloaks over filthy puddles for the Virgin Queen. However Gloriana's England was nothing less than a police state run by hawk-eyed spymasters and their treacherous employees, utterly dedicated to defending the realm from its enemies using methods of blackmail, bribery, betrayal, entrapment and violence familiar to the KGB and Gestapo.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daily Express</i></p><p>&#x201c;Absorbing and closely documented...Stephen Alford's engrossing book reminds us that most governments will stop at very little if national security is at stake.

Tracing the devious machinations of rebels and intelligence agents alike, Alford makes brilliant use of the intercepted letters, illegal publications and incendiary pamphlets found in the Elizabethan archives. A great spy novel--except that it's all true.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;The biographer of the Virgin Queen's de facto prime minister (Burghley, 2008) enters the vortex of Elizabethan espionage, which readers of the era will find irresistible....

Based on Mailer&#39;s own experience of military service in the Philippines during World War Two, &#39;The Naked and the Dead&#39; is a graphically truthful and shattering portrayal of ordinary men in battle. First published in 1949, as America was still basking in the glories of the Allied victory, it altered forever the popular perception of warfare. Focusing on the experiences of a fourteen-man platoon stationed on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific during World War II, and written in a journalistic style, it tells the moving story of the soldiers&#39; struggle to retain a sense of dignity amidst the horror of warfare, and to find a source of meaning in their lives amisdst the sounds and fury of battle.</p><p>In addition to thirty-one works of fiction and nonfiction, Norman Mailer has written numerous poems and essays, as well as directed and appeared in motion pictures. His new collection of essays, The Time of Our Time, will be published in May 1998. He lives in New York.Novel by Norman Mailer. Published in 1948, the book was hailed as one of the finest American novels to come out of World War II. The story concerns a platoon of 13 American soldiers who are stationed on the Japanese-held island of Anopopei in the Pacific. With almost journalistic detail, Mailer records the lives of men at war, characterizing the soldiers individually in flashbacks that illuminate their past. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Gweilo: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood</h2><p>Evocative, funny and full of life, this is a beautifully observed childhood memoir of growing up in colonial Hong Kong in the 1950s.<br><br>As an inquisitive seven-year-old, Martin Booth found himself with the whole of Hong Kong at his feet when his father was posted there in the early 1950s. Unrestricted by parental control, he had free access to hidden corners of the colony normally closed to a Gweilo, a &#x201c;pale fellow&#x201d; like him. Befriending rickshaw coolies and local stallholders, he learned Cantonese, sampled delicacies such as boiled water beetles and one-hundred-year-old eggs, and participated in colourful festivals. He even entered the forbidden Kowloon Walled City, wandered into the secret lair of the Triads and visited an opium den.

Praised in his lifetime by the likes of T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and John Betjeman, his reputation contines to be high. His poems take a wide range of themes from metaphysics to melancholy, social climbing to political satire, and from love to loss.</p><p>William Empson is well-known for his landmark in literary criticism SEVEN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY (written at the tender age of 24) but his poetry is regarded as his greatest literary achievement. His academic career was varied and distinguished and throughout the course of his life he published widely. John Haffenden is recognised as being the foremost authority writing on Empson today. He has written a number of books, and is currently working on a biography of Empson."Slowly the poison the whole bloodstream fills./ The waste remains, the waste remains and kills." This spectacular and assiduously compiled volume restores to print, and amplifies, the considerable achievements of a good poet and a major British intellectual. William Empson (1906-1984) remains best-known for his literary criticism, especially Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930). Despite his slender poetic output, he also belongs among the most original, strangest and most powerful poets of the British 1930s. His densely worked poems combined his devotion to John Donne with a deep knowledge of science and math: the lesser verse makes fascinating puzzles, while the standouts combine great intellect with hard self-knowledge and great range erotic love ("Camping Out"), literary parody ("Just a Smack at Auden"), a diving board, moons and planets, archaeology, real estate law, even "Dissatisfaction with Metaphysics." (Empson also, almost single-handedly, reinvented and popularized the villanelle.) The poet spent, all told, 10 years in Japan and China; his deep engagement with their history, politics, religion and language also inform later poems like "Autumn on Nan-Yueh." Haffenden's edition adds to Empson's Collected Poems (1955) an assortment of very early or lost pieces, most of which appeared in The Royal Beasts (1986); even so, the poems themselves come to just over 100 pages. What of the rest of the volume? Empson appended fascinating notes to his own poems, and Haffenden has included them all. To these he adds bibliographical and scholarly data; his own interpretive comments; and much unpublished prose by Empson and others. The result is a giant book sure to attract all Empson's admirers, and a promising attempt to place him firmly in the literary canon. (June) Forecast: The book's U.K. publication, from Penguin, sparked widespread publicity and long reviews in all the highbrow journals; American readers and editors (particularly scholarly) should follow that overseas lead. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Henry Reed, Inc.</h2><p>Henry&#39;s journal describes his adventures in free enterprise when he and his partner, Midge, start a research company</p><p>Robert McCloskey (1914-2003) wrote and illustrated some of the most honored and enduring children's books ever published.

Oh, there had been ups and downs, and the downs had seemed excursions into the flames of hell at the time&#x2014;the lingering death of his mother, Sarah&#x2019;s battle with breast cancer, the rough periods their marriage had gone through&#x2014;but, on balance, when all was said and done, it had been a good life.When all was said and done.Don shook his head, but it wasn&#x2019;t in sadness. He&#x2019;d always been a realist, a pragmatist, and he knew there was nothing left now but summing up and looking back. At the age of eighty-seven, that&#x2019;s all anyone had.The living room was narrow. A fireplace was built into the middle of one of the long walls, flanked by autopolarizing windows, but he couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time they&#x2019;d actually had a fire. It was too much work getting one going and then cleaning up afterward.The mantel held framed photos, including one of Sarah and Don on their wedding day, back in 1988. She was wearing white, and he was in a tuxedo that had been black in reality but looked gray here, having faded, along with the rest of the photograph. Other photos showed their son Carl as a toddler and again graduating with his M.B.A. from McGill, and there were two pictures of their daughter Emily, one when she was in her twenties, and another, holographic one, from her early forties. And there were several holos of their two grandchildren.There were also a few trophies: a pair of small ones that Don had won in Scrabble tournaments, and the big one Sarah had been given by the International Astronomical Union. He couldn&#x2019;t remember the wording on that one, so he walked over, taking small steps, and had a look:For Sarah HalifaxWho Figured It Out1 March 2010He nodded, remembering how proud he&#x2019;d been that day, even if her fame had briefly turned their lives upside down.A magphotic flatscreen was mounted above the mantel, and when they weren&#x2019;t watching anything it displayed the time in boxy red numerals a foot high, big enough that Sarah could see them from across the room; as she&#x2019;d often quipped, it was a good thing that she hadn&#x2019;t been an optical astronomer. It was now 3:17 in the afternoon. As Don watched, the remaining segments in the rightmost digit lit up; 3:18. The party was supposed to have begun at 3:00, but no one was here yet, and Sarah was still upstairs getting ready.Don made a mental vow to try to not be short with the grandchildren. He never meant to snap at them, but somehow, he always did; there was a constant background level of pain at his age, and it frayed his temper.He heard the front door opening. The house knew the kids&#x2019; biometrics, and they always let themselves in without ringing the bell. The living room had a short staircase at one end that led down to the entryway and a taller one at the other going up to the bedrooms. Don walked over to the base of the one going up. &#x201c;Sarah!&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re here!&#x201d;He then made his way to the other end of the room, each footfall punctuated by a tiny jab of pain. No one had come up yet&#x2014;this was Toronto in February, and, global warming be damned, there were still boots and jackets to be removed. Before he reached the top of the stairs, he&#x2019;d sorted out the m�l�e of voices; it was Carl&#x2019;s crew.He looked at them from his elevated vantage point and felt himself smiling. His son, his daughter-in-law, his grandson, and his granddaughter&#x2014;part of his immortality. Carl was bent over in a way Don would have found excruciating, pulling off one of his boots. From this angle, Don could clearly see his son&#x2019;s considerable bald spot&#x2014;trivial to correct, had Carl been vain, but neither Don nor his son, who was now fifty-four, could ever be accused of that.Angela, Carl&#x2019;s blond wife, was ten years younger than her husband. She was working to get the boots off little Cassie, who was seated on the one chair in the entryway. Cassie, who took no active role in this, looked up and saw Don, and a huge grin spread across her little round face. &#x201c;Grampa!&#x201d;He waved at her. Once all the outerwear was removed, everyone came upstairs. Angela kissed him on the cheek as she passed, carrying a rectangular cake box. She went into the kitchen. Twelve-year-old Percy was up next, then came Cassie, pulling on the banister, which she could barely reach, to help her get up the six steps.Don bent low, feeling twinges in his back as he did so. He wanted to lift Cassie up, but that was impossible. He settled for letting her get her little arms around his neck and giving him a squeeze. Cassie was oblivious to the fact that she was hurting him, and he endured it until she let go. She then scampered through the living room and followed her mother to the kitchen. He turned to watch her and saw Sarah coming down from upstairs, one painful step at a time, gripping the banister with both hands as she did so.By the time she reached the bottom step, Don heard the front door opening again, and his daughter Emily&#x2014;divorced, no kids&#x2014;coming in. Soon enough, everyone was crowded into the living room. With his cochlear implants, Don&#x2019;s hearing wasn&#x2019;t bad under normal circumstances, but he couldn&#x2019;t really pick out any one thread of conversation from the hubbub that now filled the air. Still, it was his family, all together. He was happy about that, but&#x2014;But it might be the last time. They&#x2019;d gathered just six weeks ago for Christmas at Carl&#x2019;s place, in Ajax. His children and grandchildren wouldn&#x2019;t normally all get together again until next Christmas, but&#x2014;But he couldn&#x2019;t count on there being a next Christmas; not at his age... No; that wasn&#x2019;t what he should be dwelling on. Today was a party, a celebration. He should enjoy it, and&#x2014;And suddenly there was a champagne flute in his hand. Emily was circling the room, handing them out to the adults, while Carl presented plastic tumblers of juice to the children.&#x201c;Dad, go stand by Mom,&#x201d; Carl said. And he did so, making his way across the room to where she was&#x2014;not standing; she couldn&#x2019;t stand for long. Rather, she was seated in the old La-Z-Boy. Neither of them ever reclined it anymore, although the grandkids loved to operate the mechanism. He stood next to Sarah, looking down on her thinning snow-white hair. She craned her neck as much as she could to look up at him, and a smile crossed her face, one more line in a landscape of creases and folds.&#x201c;Everybody, everybody!&#x201d; shouted Carl. He was the elder of Don and Sarah&#x2019;s kids and always took charge. &#x201c;Your attention, please!&#x201d; The conversation and laughter died down quickly, and Don watched as Carl raised his own champagne flute. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to propose a toast. To Mom and Dad, on their sixtieth wedding anniversary!&#x201d;The adults all raised their glasses, and, after a moment, the kids imitated them with their tumblers. &#x201c;To Don and Sarah!&#x201d; said Emily, and, &#x201c;To Grandma and Grandpa,&#x201d; declared Percy.Don took a sip of the champagne, the first alcohol he&#x2019;d had since New Year&#x2019;s Eve. He noted his hand was shaking even more than it normally did, not from age but with emotion.&#x201c;So, Dad, what do you say?&#x201d; asked Carl. He was grinning from ear to ear. Emily, for her part, was recording everything with her datacom. &#x201c;Would you do it all over again?&#x201d;Carl had asked the question, but Don&#x2019;s answer was really for Sarah. He set his glass on a little tea table next to the La-Z-Boy, then slowly, painfully, lowered himself onto one knee, so that he was at eye level with his seated wife. He reached over, took her hand, feeling the thin, almost translucent skin sliding over the swollen joints, and looked into her pale blue eyes. &#x201c;In a heartbeat,&#x201d; he said softly.Emily let out a long, theatrical, &#x201c;Awwww...&#x201d;Sarah squeezed his hand, and she smiled at him, the same wry smile he&#x2019;d fallen for back when they were both in their twenties, and she said, with a steadiness that her voice almost never managed these days, &#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;Carl&#x2019;s exuberance got the better of him. &#x201c;To another sixty years!&#x201d; he said, lifting his glass again, and Don found himself laughing at the ridiculousness of the proposition.&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he said, slowly rising again, then reaching for his glass. &#x201c;Why the heck not?&#x201d;The phone rang. He knew his kids thought the voice-only phones were quaint, but neither he nor Sarah had any desire to have 2-D picture phones, let alone holophones. His first thought was not to answer; let whoever it was leave a message. But it was probably a well-wisher&#x2014;maybe even his brother Bill calling from Florida, where he wintered.The cordless handset was on the other side of the room. Don lifted his eyebrows and nodded at Percy, who looked delighted to be charged with such a task. He raced across the room, and rather than just bringing over the handset, he activated it and very politely said, &#x201c;Halifax residence.&#x201d;It was possible that Emily, standing near Percy, could hear the person on the other end of the line, but Don couldn&#x2019;t make out anything. After a moment, he heard Percy say, &#x201c;Just a sec,&#x201d; and the boy started walking across the room. Don held out his hand to take the handset, but Percy shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Grandma.&#x201d;Sarah looked surprised as she took the handset, which, upon recognizing her fingerprints, automatically cranked up its volume. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she said.Don looked on with interest, but Carl was talking to Emily while Angela was making sure her children were being careful with their drinks, and&#x2014;&#x201c;Oh, my God!&#x201d; exclaimed Sarah.&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked Don.&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Sarah said, into the mouthpiece. &#x201c;Are you positive it&#x2019;s not&#x2014;No, no, of course you&#x2019;d check.

The book opens with the author's story of losing both of her parents by the age of 12 and living with an unloving stepmother. Fourteen chapters lead readers through the process of grieving and dealing with life without a parent. Quotes from former campers are interspersed throughout the book, giving insight into a variety of ways young people have dealt with loss. One teen states: People get that losing a parent is hard, but I don't think they fully understand everything we lose with them. It isn't just a person that is lost, it is a lifetime worth of memories yet to be made. Talking with a counselor, therapist, teacher, coach, or religious leader is suggested, along with keeping a journal. Information about Comfort Zone Camp is appended.

Hughes is the founder of Comfort Zone Camp, a camp for grieving children who have lost parents or siblings. She begins by telling her own unvarnished tale: her parents died before she was a teenager, and the other adults in her life were not nurturing. Noting that healing continues each time she tells her story, she then weaves the stories of more than two dozen teens who have lost parents--including several whose parents died in the attack on the World Trade Center--into chapters about grief, remembrance, loss, what helps, and moving forward. Hughes is not facile or eloquent with words, and the many quotes from the young people at Comfort Zone Camp are couched in simple, often slangy or cliched language. Still, this title may provide a pathway for teens struggling with their own inchoate and often silent grief. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As she begins an investigation, Judy discovers a shocking truth that confounds her expectations and leads her in a completely different direction. Soon she finds herself plunged into a shadowy world of people who are so desperate that they cannot go to the police&#x2015;and where others are so ruthless that they prey on vulnerability. Now Judy must locate the strength within herself to seek justice for Iris and her aunt. . .even if it comes at a terrible price.</p></p><p>LISA SCOTTOLINE is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Edgar Award-winning author of more than twenty novels.

One of the firefighters notices the use of accelerant at the scene and calls the police, but by the time Inspector Banks arrives, the fire brigade have put out the flames and only the smoldering wreckage remains. A body has been found on each barge, and all the evidence points towards a deliberate arson attack. </p><p>One of the victims is Tina, a young girl with a drug addiction and a terrible past who had been living with her boyfriend Mark. The other is Tom, an artist who had been living alone. Now, with little evidence to go on and a number of possible suspects, including Tina's boyfriend, the local 'lock-keeper' who reported the fire, and Tina's own father, Banks must begin to delve into the lives of the victims, and to discover who could have wanted them out of the way forever...</p><p>From the master of psychological suspense, Peter Robinson, comes a mind-bending thriller of secrets and murder.</p></p><p>One of the principle pleasures to be found in reading any of Peter Robinson's more recent British suspense novels is to see how dexterously this author uses seemingly small, confined crimes to wedge open much larger troves of hidden or historical chicanery. In <i>Playing with Fire</i>, the plot catalyst is a blaze that consumes two rotting barges moored in a Yorkshire canal, killing their squatter inhabitants--Tina Aspern, a pretty, teenage heroin abuser, and Thomas McMahon, a once-promising but "derivative" landscape painter who'd fallen on hard times. Accident or arson? The best suspects, in either event, may be Tina&#x2019;s cheating boyfriend, Mark Siddons, and a rumored peeping tom who'd taken his time--and more--reporting the conflagration. However, as Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his colleague and ex-lover, Annie Cabbot (both last seen in <i>Close to Home</i>), gather together the disparate threads of this case, new questions arise, suggesting that the inferno was intended to cover up still worse misdeeds. Why, for instance, had McMahon been buying old books and prints from an Eastvale antiquarian dealer? Is it true, as an angry Siddons alleges, that Tina had turned to drugs in order to blot out the pain of her stepfather's carnal advances? And what tie, if any, is there between these boat burnings and the subsequent torching of a trailer home occupied by a "quiet bloke," who perished while in possession of an unknown and potentially valuable J.M.W. Turner watercolor?<p> As attentive as Robinson is to plot progression, spicing up his narrative with arcane knowledge about fire accelerants and competition in the painting biz ("The art world's brutal," Banks is warned early on in this story), he doesn't forget that a substantial part of the attraction of this series derives from its two evolving main characters. The contemplative, jazz-loving Banks, worried by the superficiality of his latest relationship, with a "wounded" fellow cop, finds himself increasingly jealous here of Annie's suave new boyfriend, an art researcher whose past may be short a few brushstrokes. At the same time, Annie is drawn hesitantly closer again to Banks by tragic circumstances. Although Robinson's subplot about Tina's sexual violation concludes in a rather B-movieish way, <i>Playing with Fire</i> is redeemed by its scorching climax and suggestively ragged denouement. Peter Robinson, together with Ian Rankin, Reginald Hill, and others, is reinvigorating the British police procedural. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>When the bodies of two squatters are found in the burning remains of a couple of derelict barges, Inspector Alan Banks has to wonder whether one of their occupations caused their deaths. One victim was a local artist, with plenty of turpentine and oil paint at hand; the other was a young woman, a junkie, who evidently shot up her final fix just before the fire started. But if the fire was an accident, why did her boyfriend bolt from the scene when the police arrived? And why did the neighbour who discovered the fire not call it in right away? <p>As they start their investigation, Banks and his colleague (and former lover), DI Annie Cabbot, find more than enough motives for murder &#x2013; and more than one person with a reason to kill. Worse, one of the two detectives themselves discovers firsthand the seductive thrill and terrible danger of playing with fire. </p> <p>In his fourteenth Inspector Banks mystery, Peter Robinson once more displays his extraordinary skill in creating memorable characters, a haunting narrative, and a subtly unveiled plot, a talent that has made him one of the best writers of crime fiction in the world today.</p> <p><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales</h2><p>From its ancient roots in the oral tradition to the postmodernist reworkings of the present day, the fairy tale has retained its powerful hold over the cultural imagination of Europe and North America. Now <em>The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales</em> provides the first authoritative reference source for this complex, captivating genre. <br> With more than 800 entries written by a team of 67 specialists from around the world, the <em>Companion</em> offers an illuminating look at the classic tales themselves, both ancient and modern, from Jack and Jill and Cinderella to Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz. The contributors also profile the writers who wrote or reworked these luminous tales, as well as the illustrators, film-makers, choreographers, and composers who have been involved with creating or interpreting them. The <em>Companion</em> also covers such related topics as film, art, opera, ballet, music, even advertising. An introductory overview by Jack Zipes sets the subject in its historical and literary context, and special survey articles explore the development of the fairy-tale tradition in individual countries, focusing particularly on the European and North American traditions. The volume includes a detailed bibliography, to aid in further research into this fascinating topic.<br> Strikingly illustrated with 70 beautiful pictures, from early engravings to 20th-century film stills, this is an essential companion for everyone who loves fairy tales and storytelling.</p><p>This comprehensive guide is as wonderfully thorough and cross-referenced as we've come to expect from the Oxford Companions, and it deserves a place on the bookshelf of any lover of children's literature or films. Arranged alphabetically, <i>The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales</i> covers authors, illustrators, individual titles, and countries of origin for the fairy tales of Europe, from medieval times through the era of Walt Disney. Each entry is handily marked with asterisks when there's a related section to read; "The Little Mermaid" has asterisks highlighting both Hans Christian Anderson and Disney, while the larger section of Victorian Fairy Painting has 19 asterisks in its three pages of text. While authors and stories generally don't get more than a few paragraphs of detail, you'll find the quantity of entries most impressive. Beyond standard fairy tales, authors of classic children's literature and adult fantasy are often included, if their works rely in any way on earlier myths or tales--Terry Pratchett and Maurice Sendak are two examples. Larger sections devoted to regional differences are lengthy and fascinating, and they include Portugal, Spain, France, North America, Britain, and Italy. The book also has plenty of illustrations. While they're all in black and white, the variety of artistic styles is wonderful, and each plate is large enough to show charming details of giants, maidens, witches, and all the classic characters of these beloved stories. Whether your heart lies with Edward Gorey or Kate Greenaway, you're sure to enjoy the facts behind your favorite tale. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><br><strong>Jack Zipes</strong> has been Professor of German at the University of Minnesota since 1989.

The re-imagined world, called the kingdom of God, presents his followers with a new option for living, one that contrasts with the default world of the everyday.

His book also reveals how Oberammergau has become a remarkable prism through which we can view divergent ways of thinking about culture, commerce, and religion.</p><p>In 1633, the residents of the small Bavarian village of Oberammergau made a vow that, if they were spared from a plague that was sweeping the countryside, they would perform a Passion play in perpetuity. Legend has it that no more villagers died; and the town has famously kept its vow. Every decade for centuries, the people of Oberammergau have presented their play. As described by theatrical historian James Shapiro, <i>Oberammergau</i> is a fascinating cultural, commercial, and religious saga. The book is sharpest in its analysis of the villagers' ambivalent efforts to rid their play of anti-Semitism. (Hitler, who attended the play twice, praised its convincing portrayal of "the menace of Jewry.") Recent revisions in the play's text, as well as casting and costume changes, have restored an historically accurate, Hebrew quality to Jesus and the other major characters in the drama. James Shapiro, who spent a great deal of time in the village gathering material for this book, observes in detail the anxieties and scandals that attended these changes--as well as the empathy and understanding that they occasioned. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"James Shapiro has written an utterly fascinating account of a phenomenon that is at once ephemeral and eternal--a once-a-decade drama saddled with centuries of passion. With scholarly ingenuity and journalistic wits, he dissects an event that has, as Shapiro himself writes, 'profound implications for interfaith relations in a post-Holocaust world.' This book will go down as a model of cultural commentary--and a treasure."<br>-- Stephen J. Dubner, author of <b>Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family</b> <br><p>"<b>Oberammergau</b> is an obsessively readable treatment of this vexed subject, the drama which serves as such a perfect metaphor for the anguished and complex problem of Christian anti-Semitism. Professor Shapiro speaks with a scholar's authority, but with none of the obfuscation that such scholarship often entails. He sheds a most welcome light on this dark and murky terrain."<br>-- Mary Gordon</p></p><h2>The well-tempered garden</h2><p>This is Christopher Lloyd&#39;s best-known book. His famous gardens at Great Dixter draw people from around the world. His name is kept in the forefront of people&#39;s minds with constant media exposure including his weekly articles for Country Life, written since 1963 without an issue missed.</p><p>Christopher Lloyd&#39;s love of and pride in gardening is evident in every word of this often-republished gardening classic. It&#39;s not an encyclopedic text, as much of it is specifically applicable to Lloyd&#39;s damp English climate, but as he says in his new introduction, &#34;We should always keep an open mind.&#34; Gardeners in many climates will do well with the plants Lloyd loves, and everyone can follow his advice on the basics of growing and propagating healthy plants."The Well-Tempered Garden is for gardeners who have not been dragged into this pursuit but are here because they love it." So writes Christopher Lloyd in the Introduction to this superb book. Here the beginning gardener will learn the basic skills of planting, pruning, weeding, staking, and deadheading. More advanced gardening enthusiasts are guided through ways to propagate plants, to select and care for different kinds of plants - perennials, shrubs, climbers, bulbs - and are also offered ideas about the many different kinds of gardens one might keep. He offers advice on roses, vegetables, fruits, ornamental plants, wild gardening in grass, and more.A strong-minded instructor, Lloyd knows that errors are inevitable, and rather than scolding encourages learning through experience. He opens our eyes to the beauty of the unexpected surprises that happen in the garden, whether on the part of the "fallible plant" or the "fallible gardener." All this from the man Henry Mitchell called "possibly the best garden writer alive."

To find the murderer, Vicki joins forces with Reheema, a disadvantaged black woman in search of her crack-addicted mother&#39;s killer, who devolves into the girlfriend from hell. Kate Burton uses vivid characterizations and a variety of light accents to depict a range of characters. Her portrayal of the bitingly humorous exchanges between Reheema and Vicki sounds authentic. Set in the drug-ridden streets of Devil&#39;s Corner, in West Philadelphia, the story, inspired by a real-life crack-cocaine trafficking case, has an eerie realism that is matched by Burton&#39;s seamless narration.

Born in the heart of Europe in the midst of World War I, Dada displayed a raucous skepticism about accepted values. Its embrace of new materials, of collage and assemblage techniques, of the designation of manufactured objects as art objects as well as its interest in performance, sound poetry and manifestos fundamentally shaped the terms of modern art practice and created an abiding legacy for postwar art. Yet, while the word Dada has common currency, few know much about Dada art itself. In contrast to other key avant-garde movements, there has never been a major American exhibition that explores Dada specifically in broad view. <i>Dada</i>--the catalogue to the exhibition on view in 2006 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and The Museum of Modern Art in New York presents the hybrid forms of Dada art through an examination of city centers where Dada emerged: Zurich, Berlin, Cologne, Hanover, New York and Paris. Covered here are works by some 40 artists made in the period from circa 1916, when the Cabaret Voltaire was founded in Zurich, to 1926, by which time most of the Dada groups had dispersed or significantly transformed. The city sections bring together painting, sculpture, photography, collage, photomontage, prints and graphic work.<br>Relying on dynamic design and vivid documentary images, <i>Dada</i> takes us through these six cities via topical essays and extensive plate sections; an illustrated chronology of the movement; witty chronicles of events in each city center; a selected bibliography; and biographies of each artist--accompanied by Dada-era photographs.</p><p>Kurt Schwitters was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1887. He studied at the Hanover School for Applied Arts and the Art Academy in Dresden. In 1911 he participated in his first exhibition. In 1919 the first pictures of his Merz were published, as was his poem An Anna Blume. Throughout the 20s, he devoted most of his energy to working on the Merzbau and Merz magazine, and also founded a successful advertising agency in 1924. Upon the Nazi defamation of his work in 1937, he emigrated to Norway, later continuing on to England, where he died in 1948. Five years earlier, an air raid over his home in Hanover had destroyed the original Merzbau. <br> <br>Born in Philadelphia in 1890, <b>Man Ray</b> began his professional life as a painter before taking up photography in 1915.

From the classically libidinous Henry Miller to the hilariously contemporary Fran Lebowitz, <i>Drinking, Smoking and Screwing</i> includes novel excerpts, essays, poems, and short stories in a bawdy and thoroughly entertaining anthology with no warnings -- and no apologies.</p><p>Here's to the three greatest pleasures in life: a cigarette before and a martini after. <i>Drinking, Smoking &amp; Screwing</i> celebrates these less-than-holy pursuits and unlocks the sweet mystery of sin with a sordid selection of essays, stories, excerpts, and poetry from noted libertines such as Mark Twain, Charles Bukowski, Henry Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, Spalding Gray, and Dorothy Parker. Also deliciously wicked is the introduction, penned by Bob Shacochis, author of <i>Swimming the Volcano</i> and not one to shy away from a drink, a smoke, and a... Well, you get the point. He writes, "Not to defend smokers, drinkers, and fuckers would be a terrible mistake.... The world might be simple and clean, but it wouldn't be deliciously, fascinatingly, pathetically human, would it? Nor would it be much fun."

She knew him as Invention-a-Minute Ben,&#x201d; a freelancer who designed gadgets and created surgical equipment that saved lives.

A clear plastic square, palm-size, it contains what seems to be a wire model of a leafless tree: a silver trunk the thinness of embroidery thread splits into six gossamer limbs, and these, in turn, fray into lines that could be the crow's-feet around my eyes. At first glance, it's hard to imagine how such an exact replica of a tree could have been constructed on this scale. Picking it up, you find a pinhole in the base at the point where the trunk originates; and you discover that the tree is a channel carved by an electric spark. The fine-spun pattern, elaborate to the vanishing point, is what remains of an event lasting a fraction of a second. I often think that the story I want to tell is the tree left by the explosion that killed my father.<br><br>At the root of this tree is chance: my father died by chance, and it was purely by accident, years later, that I discovered he had built Israel's first rocket. He had never told me, but then he was secretive. From a chance encounter, I learned that my father had been in a secret group of scientists who had invented weapons during Israel's war of independence; and whose affection for him remained such that, when I tracked them down one memorable summer, they were willing to tell me their story, which is classified and not likely to be fully told for the balance of my lifetime. One by one, my father's secrets were unlocked, after his death, by the same principle of random chance that had killed him; all his mysteries were laid open to that summer's cleansing air and light. Now I've come to a point where I need to tell my father's story as I have slowly pieced it together, from the state secrets of Israel and my own unspoken memories.<br><br>Looking out the bay window spanning my workroom, I see the flagstone patio, and upon it, in a black pot, the spindly ruins of a tomato plant. It is mid-September. Beyond, in the sunken garden, a bank of coneflowers, bleached petals fringing their brown nubs. The herb island, raised on rocks from the grass, is a tumulus of lemon balm, mosquitoes, and the dense clustered stars of heath aster. The garden and the trees behind it have a backstage atmosphere, an air of laughing exhaustion; only a few roses are still beautiful, and in our woods, the witchy-limbed blue ashes and stout chinquapin oaks ("sweet oaks," my husband calls them) will soon be as leafless as the silver tree in my paperweight. I catch myself in a loud sigh; half contentment, half disbelief that I can call this house, these woods, home. My first permanent home. My first roots, set down in the early autumn of life, not too late, but barely. . . . I'm thinking of how my father kept my existence so secret that most of his friends were unaware he had a child. And to understand that secret, it is myself I will have to unlock.<br><br>Between thumb and forefinger, I pinch the brass pea that is a knob for the little door under the desk's top. Opening it, I remove from the shelf inside a small photograph, deckle-edged. This was given to me during the fiftieth--but still classified--reunion of the secret scientists. On the back, a note is penciled: "Passover, 1948." I'm translating. The Hebrew reads, Pesah, Tashah. Tashah, literally '48, is also the name of a generation. And here they are: the Science Corps, Hemmed in the Hebrew acronym.<br><br>In the background, a grayish yellowness so abstract it can only be the dunes of Tel Aviv, 1948. Tel Aviv, Tashah. The spring of the war. In the foreground, a crowd of twenty or so dressed for the holiday: young women in square-shouldered suits, young men in jackets, no hats, unbuttoned collars spread like wings, and all the wings are white. Each face could be covered by two grains of coarse salt. Yet each has a personality. The mustached gent on the far left conspicuously wears both a hat and an English raincoat, but spurns the camera, bushing his brows. The hip-slung woman on the far right, in a natty suit and ankle-strap pumps, seems to be winding her watch. Midway among these preoccupied college students, smack in the center, kneeling, a crack of light between his thin, baggy-trousered thighs, is my father. Grinning.<br><br>When I turn the photo upside down, it confirms that it's not just me; his face really is unique in that crowd. All the other inverted faces look like tiny beads of condensation; roundish, they would jiggle in place if you blew on them. But my father's face is a triangular highlight: he's the drop that's already sliding, committed to motion.<br><br>Two years before this snapshot, a few of them had begun meeting clandestinely in cafes, the backs of shops, and their own shabby rented rooms. They called themselves the Association for Security Research, and their goal was to concoct weapons, under a British regime that strictly forbade Jews to possess weapons. One month before declaring Israel's independence, David Ben-Gurion, the future prime minister, turned this handful of lethal dabblers into Hemmed, an official army corps with an R &amp; D budget of $3,000. What, gasped one chemist, will we do with such wealth? He was serious. Hemmed started out in a rooftop shed, improvising its weapons from scrap and guesswork. After the war, the group became a national leadership. Once I had the chance to ask Mr. Shimon Peres, the former prime minister, what he thought of Hemmed. He smiled. It was a security smile. He said they were "an extraordinary, brilliant group. And without doubt, their work is at the foundation of Israel's industrial and defense technology." They gave Israel her national water system, her state institute of defense research, her most visionary tycoon, her Atomic Energy Commission . . .<br><br>Except for my father. Who went to the United States to become, first, a self-taught medical inventor nicknamed Invention-a-Minute Ben. Then an author whose book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum: On the Mechanics of Consciousness, made him a popular guru, attracting thousands of spiritual seekers. For while his Hemmed friends were struggling to build a Jewish state, my father planned to perfect the evolution of the entire human race, a project whose success, it occurs to me now, might have made the defense of Israel unnecessary. A tall, vividly handsome man, with black upswept brows and a signature laugh, soft and childlike, he lectured to packed halls; and like all true utopians who cannot live with humanity unless they plan to improve it, he was widely loved. Once a woman leapt from her seat shouting "He knows the meaning of life!" So people said, even as my father went insane; his past dismembered his mind as surely as his body would be dismembered by a chance explosion.<br><br>. . .<br><br>Here they are. Here he is. How thrilling were those meetings with Hemmed, in the summer of 1995! I would stand at the door of some modest Israeli apartment, belonging to a stranger, and press the buzzer under the brass or ceramic nameplate. Once a charming matron flung open the door, and with tears in her eyes placed her soft palms against my face, blocking off portions of it, calling over her shoulder,<br><br>"Here she is! Here he is! Here's Itzik--and here's Itzik!"<br><br>The thrill for them was Itzhak Bentov brought back to life: his widow's peak, his slightly crossed green eyes in my face. For me, it was the company of those who shared his secret past. Who knew him. I wanted desperately to know my father. I still do.<br><br>As I balance the little photograph between my fingers, I feel what can be described as a susurrus wafting up from the picture, tingling my eardrums. It is words: "You must tell this story according to our ancient rules," insists the group, in Lilliputian chorus, faint but penetrating as the cigarette smoke that will wrap them at Passover dinner, at a table laid with the ritual egg, parsley, and lamb shank. They will read aloud from copies of the same book, each guest reciting a section. This book, relating the story of Exodus with commentaries, could be titled How the Jews Left Egypt, but it isn't. It is called The Telling, as if the act of telling had a separate, overriding importance; as if Pharaonic Egypt were merely one instance of a situation for which the master strategy, in all cases, is telling--and not just any telling, but a kind for which the instructions are specific. In each generation, says the book, each person must tell the story as if he, or she, had left Egypt personally. It's considered wicked to tell the story using the pronoun "they," instead of "I" and "we."<br><br>Now, just how am I supposed to pull this off?<br><br>I don't know the first thing about weapons or war. I've lived in Israel, but never served in the army--frankly, loud noises make my hands shake, and I can't even go fishing with my husband because a hooked, flopping bluegill looks to me like a medical emergency. For these doubts, I see, Hemmed does not care. Were they fierce? Did they ask to be stuck in what Israelis immemorially call "the Mess"? The mother who restrains her small son, her hands beside his buttoned collar as he arches gently away from her, did not ask for what's facing her, perhaps has already happened to her. What, after all, did they know, in the beginning, about weapons?<br><br>"Nothing," answers the many-voiced whisper, tinged with Misha's comic asperity, Shai's cold judgment, Aia's clear emphasis. "There was darkness in my eyes," whispers Commander No One. Dr. Einstein's advice is a tiny muffled bell: "Always begin with the impossible."<br><br>A strange impulse seizes me. Suppose I lived and died in my new home, my first permanent home, without writing another word? Surely it's transience that makes Telling all-important.

She gives much of the narration over to a seven-year-old girl, who introduces characters simply yet vividly like a series of candid snapshots. The girl observes her rather remote parents--Cesar Arguello, a wealthy landowner whom she can describe only up to his knees, and his wife, who spends her time caring for a local hunchback so as to assure her place in heaven. Contrasted with them is Nana, the nurturing Indian servant who has cared for the girl and her younger brother, Mario, since birth. As the Indians rise up against the landowners and demand their rights, Castellanos suggests that the rest of society should do the same against the fetters of male supremacy. The author does not take sides between men and women, however; both are responsible for perpetuating the unhealthy state of their lives. Ultimately, while their father struggles to hold on to some scrap of the ranch for Mario's future, both children become the innocent victims of their moral and social inheritance. And Castellanos ( Another Way to Be: Selected Works of Rosario Castellanos ) paints it all with graceful, honest strokes. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Grieving Indian</h2><p>The author describes how he overcame alcohol addiction and rebuilt his life, providing lessons to help others cope with anger, separation, alcohol abuse, and grief.</p><p>Arthur H., is an Ojibwe member of the St. Croix Band in Wisconsin.

Closing that sucker had been like shoving a twelve-inch Jack into a two-inch box and she could almost hear the sproing of her belongings popping out. <em>Welcome home,</em> she thought in the seconds before the Buick's nose smacked left-fender-first into the trunk of an old pine, stopping its slide with a bone-jarring jerk.<br><br>Well. That sucked.<br><br>Liz sat there for a minute, breathing hard and wondering how long it would be before she could pry her fingers off the steering wheel. Five minutes, maybe. Ten. She'd never been so scared in all her life.<br><br>The knock on her window almost made her wet herself. An older man with a fisherman's hat perched on his head was peering in at her and she could see a woman&#x2014;his wife, presumably&#x2014;trying to see over his shoulder. Liz read the words <em>is she dead</em> on her lips.<br><br>Rolling down her window, Liz forced a reassuring smile. "I really appreciate you stopping, but I'm fine, thank you."<br><br>"You just sit tight," the man said. "My wife called 9-1-1 for you."<br><br>Oh, no. No no no. "You didn't have to do that. I'm okay. Really. Not even a scratch on me."<br><br>She wasn't entirely sure of that fact, but she didn't seem to hurt anywhere. Just a whole lot of muscles that had tensed up and were now relaxing. And maybe a little headache starting.<br><br>"It's no trouble at all, and we'll stay with you until the police arrive."<br><br>Maybe it wouldn't be Drew Miller. He was the chief of police in Whitford, after all, so maybe he didn't respond to minor traffic accidents. He probably sat at his desk and pushed papers while sending patrol officers to minor accident scenes. She hoped.<br><br>Liz pulled the handle to open the door, but Mister Good Samaritan pushed against it. "You shouldn't move around until the paramedics check you out."<br><br>"It's raining. You should get back in your car." So she could have relative privacy to scope out how many of her belongings were getting soaked. When the man shook his head, she bit down on a sigh of frustration. "I slid off the road and clipped a tree. It's not even a real accident."<br><br>"You could be in shock."<br><br>From sideswiping a tree? Not likely. But she couldn't be any more firm with her would-be rescuers without being rude. "I didn't even hit my head on the window."<br><br>"Better safe than sorry."<br><br>It was another five very awkward minutes before she heard the siren. Rather than being relieved rescue from her hovering Good Samaritans was imminent, Liz leaned her head back and closed her eyes. She didn't even bother hoping it wasn't the chief as the wailing grew closer. The way her luck was running, it would be Drew and everything was about to get a lot more awkward.<br><br>"Don't go to sleep, honey," Mrs. Good Samaritan yelled through the window. "You might have a head injury. Stay with us!"<br><br>She wasn't going anywhere, but she opened her eyes to make her rescuers feel better. And because she had her eyes wide open, she couldn't miss the Whitford Police Department cruiser that pulled up. It wasn't a sedan with the familiar striped scheme down the side. No, this one was a big, black, shiny, four-by-four SUV with a light bar across the roof and the town seal on the door. It was the kind of vehicle the top of the departmental food chain drove.<br><br>The door opened and the Whitford police chief stepped out. Drew Miller was tall and ruggedly built, which she found incredibly sexy because, at almost six feet herself, she didn't meet many men who could pull off the <em>me Tarzan</em> thing with her.<br><br>He wore the department's short-sleeved summer uniform, and a ball cap with WPD printed on it covered his dark hair. No rolling up onto the balls of his feet and hitching his gun belt for Drew. He commanded any room he was in whether he was armed or not.<br><br>He even commanded outdoor spaces, Liz realized as she watched him head toward her car with long, confident strides. He had sunglasses on, but she didn't need to see his eyes to know his focus was one hundred percent on her.<br><br>"Are you hurt?"<br><br>Liz wasn't sure if she heard him or was simply able to read his lips because she was staring at his mouth. He had an amazing mouth. It was the first thing she'd noticed the day of her brother's wedding reception.<br><br>"Liz, are you hurt?"<br><br>She shook her head in answer to his question.<br><br>"We didn't let her move," the husband and wife said at the same time.<br><br>"Thank you. It's always better to be safe than sorry and I can't tell you how much we appreciate citizens who go out of their way to help when they witness somebody in need."<br><br>While the couple talked over each other in a rush to tell Drew how she'd lost control of her car in the rain and parked it in the trees, Liz took advantage of their distraction to get out and survey the damage. There was a lot of crumpled sheet metal and the ground was littered with broken lens covers.<br><br>In a rare stroke of good luck, it didn't look like anything had flown out of the trunk. No underwear or toiletries or other personal belongings on display, though the top layer of bags and small boxes was going to take a while to dry.<br><br>"So she wasn't speeding, then?" she heard Drew ask, and she knew him well enough to hear the undertone of amusement in his voice. He said it loud enough for her benefit, too.<br><br>Liz waited, her cheeks hot with humiliation and maybe something else, while Drew called in a status update and gently but firmly sent her two Good Samaritans on their way. She called out a thank-you, managing a wave and a smile as they left.<br><br>"You're sure you're not hurt?" he asked her again once the official part of his duties were over.<br><br>"I'm sure." She couldn't think of anything to say after that, which annoyed her. She'd known Drew since she was a kid and, just because they'd had sex the one time, she was as awkward as a middle-school girl with a bad crush.<br><br>He moved closer, looking her up and down. She told herself it had to be a police thing&#x2014;checking her for injuries&#x2014;but his slow perusal didn't help cool her face any. Once he was satisfied with what he saw, presumably injury-wise, he took a slow walk around the car.<br><br>"Can't say what your total damage will be, but with the way that fender's crunched up against the tire, I know you can't drive it."<br><br>"Great." Hell of a way to kick off her brand-new life, she thought as he radioed in a request for a tow truck.<br><br>"Why does it look like you have everything you own in this car?" he asked when he was done.<br><br>"Because everything I own is in this car."<br><br>His face was so expressionless, she knew it had to be a deliberate effort on his part. Some kind of cop face, maybe. "Why?"<br><br>Liz found it hard to believe the chief of police in a town that loved gossip as much as Whitford hadn't heard. "I'm moving back for good."<br><br>"Oh." Seconds ticked by in awkward silence. "I didn't know that. Mitch has been traveling, but I was at the lodge weekend before last and nobody mentioned it."<br><br>Mitch, Liz's older brother, was Drew's best friend. And Drew's dad, Andy, was now shacking up at the Northern Star Lodge&#x2014;the Kowalski family business&#x2014;with Rosie, who was called the housekeeper, but had practically raised Liz and her four brothers. How Drew could be out of the family gossip loop was beyond her.<br><br>"I made the decision last weekend and it was pretty fast. As in, I got off the phone with Rosie and packed my car." She gave a rueful laugh and waved a hand at the car. "I probably should have taken the time to have the tires changed."<br><br>He didn't laugh. "What made you decide to come back?"<br><br>It was a reasonable question, since she'd lived most of her adult life in New Mexico, but she wasn't about to stand around in the rain and tell him how lonely and isolated from her family she'd felt. "Seemed like the thing to do. You don't have to stay, you know. I can wait for the tow truck."<br><br>"Actually I do have to stay. This is a bad spot to be loading up a ramp truck, especially in this rain, so I'll need to do some traffic control."<br><br>Traffic was a bit of a stretch, but she had to admit he had a point. Because of the angle of her car, the nose of the tow truck would have to be in the road and that meant he had to stay and wait.<br><br>Standing in the rain, alone with Drew Miller. She'd come back to start her life over and, so far, it was off to one hell of a beginning.<br><br>Drew Miller wanted to get back in his cruiser, hit the lights and sirens, and drive as fast as he could to anywhere but here.<br><br>Liz Kowalski was back in Whitford. His best friend's little sister. The woman he'd enjoyed a rebound quickie with during said best friend's wedding reception with the unspoken understanding Liz would be returning to New Mexico. And, more importantly, she would be staying there.<br><br>Not forever, of course. But he'd thought enough time would pass before her next visit so he could look at her without instantly remembering the way she looked naked, with her hair tangled around his fingers and her hips arching up to meet his.<br><br>He wasn't sure how much time that would be, other than obviously more than the eight months or so that had passed since Mitch's wedding.<br><br>She was dressed for a road trip, in old jeans that hugged her long legs and an even older T-shirt that was doing some body hugging of its own, thanks to the rain. Her thick, dark hair was pulled into a long ponytail and she sure as hell didn't need makeup to show off those brilliant blue eyes. With her strong, stubborn jaw and skin that was tanned by the New Mexico sun, Liz looked as delicious to him as she had the last time he'd seen her. And just look how that had turned out&#x2014;he was keeping secrets from his best friend.<br><br>Standing with her on the side of the road in the light drizzle, all he could do was hope the tow truck driver made good time and to hell with speed limits. For now, more awkward conversation. "Are you moving into the lodge?"<br><br>It would make sense. Liz's family had owned the Northern Star Lodge for several generations, catering to hunters before turning their attention to snowmobilers and now adding the ATV crowd, as well. He knew Liz's childhood room was still pretty much hers, even though it was occasionally used by other family members, because he'd been in her room last October. It only made sense she'd save money by moving back into it.<br><br>That made things a little complicated for Drew, however. His dad had moved into the lodge and helped manage it after falling for the housekeeper. Since Andy was his dad and Rosie was like a mother to Liz, that was entirely too much togetherness for him.<br><br>"I'm trying to go forward, not backward," Liz said. "Ryan and Lauren put her house on the market now that she lives in Massachusetts with him, but they haven't had a decent offer so they agreed to rent it to me."<br><br>And since Ryan was her older brother, she was probably getting it for a good price. "And work?"<br><br>"I guess since Whitford got connected to the ATV trails, business has really picked up in town, so I'm going to help Paige out at the diner. Handy having a sister-in-law who owns the place."<br><br>"Good. That's...good." He lapsed into silence again but then, after watching her shift her weight from foot to foot while looking everywhere but at him, he laughed. "For God's sake, Liz, this is ridiculous."<br><br>A slow grin curved her mouth and he finally got a glimpse of the girl he'd known as a kid. "You're right. We're acting like idiots."<br><br>"So let's stop." Adult Liz was almost a stranger to him&#x2014;except for the whole sex thing&#x2014;but he'd grown up with the Kowalskis and he'd always liked Liz.<br><br>"We're adults," she said. "There was alcohol. We snuck off for a rebound quickie, which happens all the time at weddings. So what?"<br><br>So what? It was all he could do not to push her up against a tree and repeat the experience, that's what. Though, without the quickie part. He wanted to take his time. And, since he'd been playing designated taxi service that night, alcohol hadn't factored into his decision to whisper his bold invitation into her ear.<br><br>And, because he'd watched her the entire afternoon, he knew it hadn't really played into her decision to accept, either. She'd had a couple of drinks during Mitch and Paige's reception, but she'd been far from drunk.<br><br>But being chief had honed his acting skills and he was ready to put this eight-months-delayed morning-after awkwardness behind them. "Not a big deal. And now, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it doesn't look like you'll be driving this car anytime soon, so let's move your stuff into my SUV before the tow truck gets here."<br><br>He watched her chew at her bottom lip for a few seconds before she gave a resigned sigh. "I'll be lucky if Butch can get parts for it, never mind fix it in a hurry."<br><br>Butch Benoit ran the garage and gas part of the Whitford General Store &amp; Service Station while his wife, Fran, ran the store part. He was an honest guy who didn't play games and very few residents made the drive into the city to save a few bucks on service. "I think he'll tell you to get whatever you can from the insurance company and use it as a down payment on something a little newer."<br><br>She swore under her breath, but leaned into the car to get her purse and assorted other belongings from the front seat. He pulled the SUV as close as he could and started transferring things from the truck. By the time Butch arrived with the ramp truck, her car was empty of everything except the trash a long road trip generated, and his SUV was loaded down with her damp boxes and bags.<br><br>Drew moved his vehicle to make way for the tow truck, their light bars flashing bright in the night, then watched while Butch ran the hydraulics and dragged Liz's car up the ramp.<br><br>"You sure know how to make an entrance, girl," Butch told Liz once the wreck was strapped down. "I'll look it over tomorrow, but even if you didn't muck up the frame, it ain't gonna be easy finding fenders for this one. Insured?"<br><br>"Yeah," Liz said.<br><br>She looked like somebody had kicked her dog, so Drew suspected she wasn't anticipating getting a lot from her insurance company. The car simply wasn't worth very much, even before she'd crumpled it up.<br><br></p><h2>Corgiville Fair</h2><p>Chronicles the events of the Corgiville Fair, especially the foul play by Edgar Tomcat in his attempt to win the goat race.</p><p>Tasha Tudor is among the most prolific and revered illustrators of all time.

Montgomery's granddaughter.</strong></p><p>There's never a dull moment in the life of wonderful, whimsical Anne. The adoring mother of five lively children&#x2015;with a baby on the way!&#x2015;Anne's life is full to bursting. And that's before the overbearing Aunt Mary Maria arrives for a lengthy visit...</p><p>Still, there's nowhere Annie would rather be than her own beloved Ingleside in the adoring arms of her husband, Gilbert. Life with her imaginative, adventurous children seems close to perfect until Anne begins to worry that her very busy doctor doesn't love her anymore. She may be a little older, but she's still the same irrepressible, irreplaceable Anne of Green Gables&#x2015;and she's ready to make her darling husband fall in love with her all over again!</p><p>Anne Shirley once said, "Dear old world, you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you." That sentiment is echoed by readers around the world who've fallen in love with this remarkable heroine.</p></p><p>L.M. Montgomery achieved international fame in her lifetime that endures well over a century later. A prolific writer, she published some 500 short stories and poems and twenty novels. Most recognized for Anne of Green Gables, her work has been hailed by Mark Twain, Margaret Atwood, Madeleine L&#39;Engle and Princess Kate, to name a few. Today, Montgomery&#39;s novels, journals, letters, short stories, and poems are read and studied by general readers and scholars from around the world. Her writing appeals to people who love beauty and to those who struggle against oppression.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p> <p>"How white the moonlight is tonight!" said Anne Blythe to herself, as she went up the walk of the Wright garden to Diana Wright's front door, where little cherry-blossom petals were coming down on the salty, breeze-stirred air.</p> <p>She paused for a moment to look about her on hills and woods she had loved in olden days and still loved. Dear Avonlea! Glen St. Mary was home to her now and had been home for many years but Avonlea had something that Glen St. Mary could never have. Ghosts of herself met her at every turn...the fields she had roamed in welcomed her...unfading echoes of the old sweet life were all about her...every spot she looked upon had some lovely memory. There were haunted gardens here and there where bloomed all the roses of yesteryear. Anne always loved to come home to Avonlea even when, as now, the reason for her visit had been a sad one. She and Gilbert had come up for the funeral of his father and Anne had stayed for a week. Marilla and Mrs. Lynde could not bear to have her go away too soon.</p> <p>Her old porch gable room was always kept for her and when Anne had gone to it the night of her arrival she found that Mrs. Lynde had put a big, homey bouquet of spring flowers in it for her...a bouquet that, when Anne buried her face in it, seemed to hold all the fragrance of unforgotten years. The Anne-who-used-to-be was waiting there for her. Deep, dear old gladnesses stirred in her heart. The gable room was putting its arms around her...enclosing her...enveloping her. She looked lovingly at her old bed with the apple-leaf spread Mrs. Lynde had knitted and the spotless pillows trimmed with deep lace Mrs. Lynde had crocheted...at Marilla's braided rugs on the floor...at the mirror that had reflected the face of the little orphan, with her unwritten child's forehead, who had cried herself to sleep there that first night so long ago. Anne forgot that she was the joyful mother of five children...with Susan Baker again knitting mysterious bootees at Ingleside. She was Anne of Green Gables once more.</p> <p>Mrs. Lynde found her still staring dreamily in the mirror when she came in, bringing clean towels.</p> <p>"It's real good to have you home again, Anne, that's what. It's nine years since you went away, but Marilla and I can't seem to get over missing you. It's not so lonesome now since Davy got married...Millie is a real nice little thing...such pies!...though she's curious as a chipmunk about everything. But I've always said and always will say that there's nobody like you."</p> <p>"Ah, but this mirror can't be tricked, Mrs. Lynde. It's telling me plainly, &#x2018;You're not as young as you once were,'" said Anne whimsically.</p> <p>"You've kept your complexion very well," said Mrs. Lynde consolingly. "Of course you never had much color to lose."</p> <p>"At any rate, I've never a hint of a second chin yet," said Anne gaily. "And my old room remembers me, Mrs. Lynde. I'm glad...it would hurt me so if I ever came back and found it had forgotten me. And it's wonderful to see the moon rising over the Haunted Wood again."</p> <p>"It looks like a great big piece of gold in the sky, doesn't it?" said Mrs. Lynde, feeling that she was taking a wild, poetical flight and thankful that Marilla wasn't there to hear.</p> <p>"Look at those pointed firs coming out against it...and the birches in the hollow still holding their arms up to the silver sky. They're big trees now...they were just baby things when I came here...that does make me feel a bit old."</p> <p>"Trees are like children," said Mrs. Lynde. "It's dreadful the way they grow up the minute you turn your back on them. Look at Fred Wright...he's only thirteen but he's nearly as tall as his father. There's a hot chicken pie for supper and I made some of my lemon biscuits for you. You needn't be a mite afraid to sleep in that bed. I aired the sheets today...and Marilla didn't know I did it and gave them another airing...and Millie didn't know either of us did and gave them a third. I hope Mary Maria Blythe will get out tomorrow...she always enjoys a funeral so."</p> <p>"Aunt Mary Maria...Gilbert always calls her that although she is only his father's cousin...always calls me &#x2018;Annie,'" shuddered Anne. "And the first time she saw me after I was married she said, &#x2018;It's so strange Gilbert picked you. He could have had so many nice girls.' Perhaps that's why I've never liked her...and I know Gilbert doesn't either, though he's too clannish to admit it."</p> <p>"Will Gilbert be staying up long?"</p> <p>"No. He has to go back tomorrow night. He left a patient in a very critical condition."</p> <p>"Oh, well, I suppose there isn't much to keep him in Avonlea now, since his mother went last year. Old Mr. Blythe never held up his head after her death...just hadn't anything left to live for. The Blythes were always like that...always set their affections too much on earthly things. It's real sad to think there are none of them left in Avonlea. They were a fine old stock. But then...there's any amount of Sloanes. The Sloanes are still Sloanes, Anne, and will be forever and ever, world without end, amen."</p> <p>"Let there be as many Sloanes as there will, I'm going out after supper to walk all over the old orchard by moonlight. I suppose I'll have to go to bed finally...though I've always thought sleeping on moonlight nights a waste of time...but I'm going to wake early to see the first faint morning light steal over the Haunted Wood. The sky will turn to coral and the robins will be strutting around...perhaps a little gray sparrow will light on the windowsill...and there'll be gold and purple pansies to look at..."</p> <p>"But the rabbits has et up all the June lily bed," said Mrs. Lynde sadly, as she waddled downstairs, feeling secretly relieved that there need be no more talk about the moon. Anne had always been a bit queer that way. And there did not any longer seem to be much use in hoping she would outgrow it.</p> <p>Diana came down the walk to meet Anne. Even in the moonlight you saw that her hair was still black and her cheeks rosy and her eyes bright. But the moonlight could not hide that she was something stouter than in years agone...and Diana had never been what Avonlea folks called "skinny."</p> <p>"Don't worry, darling...I haven't come to stay..."</p> <p>"As if I'd worry over that," said Diana reproachfully. "You know I'd far rather spend the evening with you than go to the reception. I feel I haven't seen half enough of you and now you're going back day after tomorrow. But Fred's brother, you know...we've just got to go."</p> <p>"Of course you have. And I just ran up for a moment. I came the old way, Di...past the Dryad's Bubble...through the Haunted Wood...past your bowery old garden...and along by Willowmere. I even stopped to watch the willows upside down in the water as we always used to do. They've grown so."</p> <p>"Everything has," said Diana with a sigh. "When I look at young Fred! We've all changed so...except you. You never change, Anne. How do you keep so slim? Look at me!"</p> <p>"A bit matronish of course," laughed Anne. "But you've escaped the middle-aged spread so far, Di. As for my not changing...well, Mrs. H. B. Donnell agrees with you. She told me at the funeral that I didn't look a day older. But Mrs. Harmon Andrews doesn't. She said, &#x2018;Dear me, Anne, how you've failed!' It's all in the beholder's eye...or conscience. The only time I feel I'm getting along a bit is when I look at the pictures in the magazines. The heroes and heroines in them are beginning to look too young to me. But never mind, Di...we're going to be girls again tomorrow. That's what I've come up to tell you. We're going to take an afternoon and evening off and visit all our old haunts...every one of them. We'll walk over the spring fields and through those ferny old woods. We'll see all the old familiar things we loved and hills where we'll find our youth again. Nothing ever seems impossible in spring, you know. We'll stop feeling parental and responsible and be as giddy as Mrs. Lynde really thinks me still in her heart of hearts. There's really no fun in being sensible all the time, Diana."</p> <p>"My, how like you that sounds! And I'd love to. But..."</p> <p>"There aren't any buts. I know you're thinking, &#x2018;Who'll get the men's supper?'"</p> <p>"Not exactly. Anne Cordelia can get the men's supper as well as I can, if she is only eleven," said Diana proudly. "She was going to, anyway. I was going to the Ladies' Aid. But I won't. I'll go with you. It will be like having a dream come true. You know, Anne, lots of evenings I sit down and just pretend we're little girls again. I'll take our supper with us..."</p> <p>"And we'll eat it back in Hester Gray's garden...I suppose Hester Gray's garden is still there?"</p> <p>"I suppose so," said Diana doubtfully. "I've never been there since I was married. Anne Cordelia explores a lot...but I always tell her she mustn't go too far from home. She loves prowling about the woods...and one day when I scolded her for talking to herself in the garden she said she wasn't talking to herself...she was talking to the spirit of the flowers. You know that dolls' tea set with the tiny pink rosebuds you sent her for her ninth birthday. There isn't a piece broken...she's so careful. She only uses it when the Three Green People come to tea with her. I can't get out of her who she thinks they are. I declare in some ways, Anne, she's far more like you than she is like me."</p> <p>"Perhaps there's more in a name than Shakespeare allowed. Don't grudge Anne Cordelia her fancies, Diana. I'm always sorry for children who don't spend a few years in fairyland."</p> <p>"Olivia Sloane is our teacher now," said Diana doubtfully. "She's a B.A., you know, and just took the school for a year to be near her mother. She says children should be made to face realities."</p> <p>"Have I lived to hear you taking up with Sloanishness, Diana Wright?"</p> <p>"No...no...no! I don't like her a bit...She has such round staring blue eyes like all that clan. And I don't mind Anne Cordelia's fancies. They're pretty...just like yours used to be. I guess she'll get enough &#x2018;reality' as life goes on."</p> <p>"Well, it's settled then. Come down to Green Gables about two and we'll have a drink of Marilla's red currant wine...she makes it now and then in spite of the minister and Mrs. Lynde...just to make us feel real devilish."</p> <p>"Do you remember the day you set me drunk on it?" giggled Diana, who did not mind "devilish" as she would if anybody but Anne used it. Everybody knew Anne didn't really mean things like that. It was just her way.</p> <p>"We'll have a real do-you-remember day tomorrow, Diana. I won't keep you any longer...there's Fred coming with the buggy. Your dress is lovely."</p> <p>"Fred made me get a new one for the wedding. I didn't feel we could afford it since we built the new barn, but he said he wasn't going to have his wife looking like someone that was sent for and couldn't go when everybody else would be dressed within an inch of her life. Wasn't that just like a man?"</p> <p>"Oh, you sound just like Mrs. Elliott at the Glen," said Anne severely. "You want to watch that tendency. Would you like to live in a world where there were no men?"</p> <p>"It would be horrible," admitted Diana. "Yes, yes, Fred, I'm coming. Oh, all right! Till tomorrow then, Anne."</p> <p>Anne paused by the Dryad's Bubble on her way back. She loved that old brook so. Every trill of her childhood's laughter that it had ever caught, it had held and now seemed to give out again to her listening ears. Her old dreams...she could see them reflected in the clear Bubble...old vows...old whispers...the brook kept them all and murmured of them...but there was no one to listen save the wise old spruces in the Haunted Wood that had been listening so long.</p></p><h2>Traditions &amp; Encounters - A Global Perspective on the Past 2005 (Third Edition)</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Lunar Notes - Zoot Horn Rollo&#39;s Captain Beefheart Experience</h2><p>Bill Harkleroad joined Captain Beefheart&#39;s Magic Band at a time when they were changing from a straight ahead blues band into something completely different. Through the vision of Don Van Vliet (Captain Beefheart) they created a new form of music which many at the time considered atonal and difficult, but which over the years has continued to exert a powerful influence. Beefheart re-christened Harkleroad as Zoot Horn Rollo, and they embarked on recording one of the classic rock albums of all time - Trout Mask Replica �- a work of unequalled daring and inventiveness. Further LPs like Lick My Decals Off Baby and Clear Spot highlighted what a truly innovative band they were, and what a dazzlingly original guitarist Harkleroad was becoming. Since Captain Beefheart&#39;s retirement from the music industry, many outside commentators have tried to put their finger on what was so special about The Magic Band of that time. Now for the first time we get the insider&#39;s story. Harkleroad reviews the often uncomfortable and difficult inner workings of the band, giving an unparalleled insight into the way the music was put together. At last, we find out what it was like to record, play and live with an eccentric genius such as Beefheart.</p><p></p><h2>Poor Tom Is Cold</h2><p>A woman&#39;s evil stepchildren plot to lock her away in a sanitarium for the insane in order to steal her husband&#39;s estate, in a mystery set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century Toronto.</p><p>In this third adventure featuring the lovable detective William Murdoch, he becomes involved with the apparent suicide of Constable Oliver Wicken ? a man who was the sole support of his mother and invalid sister. But further investigation by Detective Murdoch takes him far afield and he begins to suspect that the Eakin family, whose house adjoins the one where Wicken died, is more involved with the case than they admit.

The Dalai Lama's latest collection of lectures is like that. As you read, you begin to think what a wonderful world it would be if everybody thought like the Dalai Lama. Though the highest ranked leader of a world religion, the Dalai Lama insists that some of the most important aspects of Buddhist practice are nonreligious, particularly the training of the mind. This he sees as essential to cultivating basic decency in the day-to-day life of all people. To understand the motivations of others, to rein in negative emotions, to examine one's own motivations--these are the steps to living peacefully and responsibly in the world. On a deeper theoretical level, the Dalai Lama also introduces the importance of seeing through reality to the two levels of truth as well as exploring karma and the nature of existence. Impromptu question-and-answer sessions round out some of the lectures, giving the listeners a chance to pose their own questions.

Seminal works like The Tender Carnivore and the Sacred Game, Thinking Animals, and Nature and Madness introduced readers to new and provocative ideas about humanity and its relationship to the natural world. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Paul Shepard returned repeatedly to his guiding theme, the central tenet of his thought: that our essential human nature is a product of our genetic heritage, formed through thousands of years of evolution during the Pleistocene epoch, and that the current subversion of that Pleistocene heritage lies at the heart of today's ecological and social ills.<br> Coming Home to the Pleistocene provides the fullest explanation of that theme. Completed just before his death in the summer of 1996, it represents the culmination of Paul Shepard's life work and constitutes the clearest, most accessible expression of his ideas. Coming Home to the Pleistocene pulls together the threads of his vision, considers new research and thinking that expands his own ideas, and integrates material within a new matrix of scientific thought that both enriches his original insights and allows them to be considered in a broader context of current intellectual controversies. In addition, the book explicitly addresses the fundamental question raised by Paul Shepard's work: What can we do to recreate a life more in tune with our genetic roots? In this book, Paul Shepard presents concrete suggestions for fostering the kinds of ecological settings and cultural practices that are optimal for human health and well-being.<br> Coming Home to the Pleistocene is a valuable book for those familiar with the life and work of Paul Shepard, as well as for new readers seeking an accessible introduction to and overview of his thought.<br></p><p><p>Until his death in 1996, Paul Shepard was Avery Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at Pitzer College and the Claremont Graduate School.

Leonie spends her every waking moment balancing the ledgers and thinking of ways to keep the shop in the black. Securing new clients is one way to keep Maison Noirot one step ahead of the competition, and giving Lady Gladys Fairfax a much-needed fashion makeover will demonstrate to the rest of the ladies in the ton the superiority of Maison Noirot&#x2019;s designs. The only wild card in Leonie&#x2019;s otherwise carefully calibrated plan is Glady&#x2019;s cousin, Simon Blair, the marquess of Lisburne. Whichever way Leonie turns, the sinfully sexy nobleman seems to be constantly underfoot, distracting Leonie with some nonsensical ideas about all work and no play. With her gorgeously rendered prose, flawless sense of characterization, and rare gift for effortlessly matching sparkling wit and seductive passion, Chase will once again charm readers into swooning with delight.

The books on this list range from standard spiritual classics to novels, poems, and mysteries, and include an equally broad spectrum of authors -- from Augustine and C. S. Lewis to William Faulkner and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

From wooly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers to giant ground sloths and armadillos the size of automobiles, these spectacular creatures roamed freely. Then human beings arrived. Devouring their way down the food chain as they spread across the planet, they began a process of voracious extinction that has continued to the present.<br><br>Headlines today are made by the existential threat confronting remaining large animals such as rhinos and pandas. But the devastation summoned by humans extends to humbler realms of creatures including beetles, bats and butterflies. Researchers generally agree that the current extinction rate is nothing short of catastrophic. Currently the earth is losing about a hundred species every day.<br><br>This relentless extinction, Ashley Dawson contends in a primer that combines vast scope with elegant precision, is the product of a global attack on the commons, the great trove of air, water, plants and creatures, as well as collectively created cultural forms such as language, that have been regarded traditionally as the inheritance of humanity as a whole.<br><br>This attack has its genesis in the need for capital to expand relentlessly into all spheres of life. Extinction, Dawson argues, cannot be understood in isolation from a critique of our economic system. To achieve this we need to transgress the boundaries between science, environmentalism and radical politics. <i>Extinction: A Radical History</i> performs this task with both brio and brilliance.</p><p><b>Ashley Dawson</b> is a professor of English at CUNY, New York City.

But how this came to be is a complex story--one that Stephen Nichols tells with care and ease. Beginning with the Puritans, he leads readers through the various cultural epochs of American history, showing at each stage how American notions of Jesus were shaped by the cultural sensibilities of the times, often with unfortunate results. Always fascinating and often humorous, <em>Jesus Made in America</em> offers a frank assessment of the story of Christianity in America, including the present. For those interested in the cultural implications of that story, this book is a must-read.</p><p>Stephen J. Nichols (Ph.D., Westminster Theological Seminary) is professor of theology and church history at Lancaster Bible College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He is the coeditor of <em>The Legacy of Jonathan Edwards: American Religion and the Evangelical Tradition</em> and the author of many books, including <em>The Reformation: How a Monk and a Mallet Changed the World</em> and <em>For Us and for Our Salvation: The Doctrine of Christ in the Early Church.</em> He chairs the American Christianity section of the Evangelical Theological Society."Nichols's critique will provoke thought and lively discussion on issues that today's Christians need to consider." (James Gorman, Restoration Quarterly, 53:2, 2011)<br><br>"<em>Jesus Made in America</em> is written in a lively style, one from which the author's voice clearly and uniquely rings. His case is compelling and his argument is one that needs to receive a wide reading in evangelical churches. May Nichols' work cause evangelicals to rediscover the robust Jesus of the Holy Scripture." (Jeff Robinson, Towers, August 16, 2010)<br><br>I found Nichols' book stimulating, challenging and troubling. The stimulation comes from the writing of a competent scholar who examines the current literature and cultural commentaries. I found it challenging because I too am a part of the consumerismn that grips our culture and our churches. The troublesome part of Nichols' book is that it is much too close to home. Nichols' book may make us examine our cultural and spiritual experiences and relate them to our motives and contributions to linguistics and Bible translation. (Karl J. Franklin, Christian Scholar's Review, Winter 2009)<br><br>Nichols has useful things to say about the evangelical use of media, especially music and film, and about the commercialization and politicization of Jesus in our own time by evangelical Christians. (Howard Miller, The Journal of American History, June 2009)<br><br>Nichols takes the reader on a history of America through the person of Jesus. How have we formulated Him to fit our collective conscience? Nichols advises: listen to scripture first, listen to tradition, and listen to experience. (JD, Libraries Alive, Winter 2009)<br><br>I certainly recommend Nichol's book to those evangelicals who wish to be capable of critically evaluating their culture, who are open to the painful experience of realizing that not everything you have assumed even as part of your Christian worldview deserves the label "Christian." For all those interested in American Christian culture, but in particular for those who participate in it, Nichol's book provides a helpful perspective and much valuable insight. (James F.

When his debut collection Separate Flights arrived in 1975, it was immediately celebrated. "Dubus is the sort of writer who instructs the heart, and he ought to be discovered by any number of readers," wrote The Atlantic Monthly. The collection won the Boston Globe's Laurence L. &amp; Thomas Winship/PEN New England Award.<br><br>The collection includes the novella "We Don't Live Here Anymore," which served as the basis for the 2004 film of the same title (nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival); the novella also introduces Dubus's writer-protagonist Hank Allison, a character who continues to appear throughout his work.<br><br>Two years later, the title story of Dubus's sophomore collection Adultery and Other Choices continued the exploits of Hank Allison. "The title story alone will make it worth your while to go out and get the book," wrote the New York Times Book Review.<br><br>While the collection's opening stories focus on the fragile nature of youth, later stories shift to darker struggles of adulthood, such as in "Andromache"-Dubus's first story to appear in The New Yorker (1968)-which traces the aftermath of a tragic death during wartime.</p><p>Andre Dubus was the award-winning author of seven collections of stories and novellas, one novel, and two collections of essays. After the publication of his debut story collection in 1975 ( Separate Flights, David R. Godine, Publisher), Dubus devoted his writing life to the story form. Considered one of the greatest American short story writers of the twentieth century, his work is notable for its spare prose and illuminative insights into the human heart. Dubus is often compared to Anton Chekhov. Andre Dubus (1936 1999) is considered among the most talented American short story writers of his generation. Born and raised in Louisiana, he graduated from the revered University of Iowa Writers Workshop, and spent his adult life living and writing in blue-collar mill towns in northern New England. Dubus s short stories and essays appeared in distinguished literary journals and magazines across the country, and were selected for numerous editions of the &#34;Best American Short Stories&#34; series, as well as the O. Henry Awards and Pushcart Prize anthologies. Dubus s work earned him MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships, the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story, the Rea Award for the Short Story, the Jean Stein Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and nominations for a National Book Critics Circle Award and Pulitzer Prize. In addition to seven collections of stories and novellas, Dubus published one novel and two collections of essays. The critically acclaimed films In the Bedroom and We Don&#39;t Live Here Anymore were adapted from his stories.The short story never rested in more honest hands that when Dubus wrote it. --Finnegan Schick, The New Criterion<br><br>WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and THE WINTER FATHER...bring together the fiction of Andre Dubus, one of the 20th century's most gifted short story writers, who, like Raymond Carver, became a master of the form... --The New York Times<br><br>The solidly yet intricately constructed short stories and novellas of Dubus vibrate with provocative intensity of place, predicament, thought and feeling. Each is an intimate, unnerving dream of the everyday conflicts between dream and reality, spirit and desire. --Booklist, Starred Review</p><h2>The Twelve Children of Paris</h2><p>Twelve Children of Paris</p><p>Tim Willocks is a novelist, screenwriter and producer.

Father John O&#x2019;Malley set his pen down and pushed the notes he&#x2019;d been making into a neat stack. Topics for next month&#x2019;s sermons, ideas for the men&#x2019;s club he&#x2019;d started this fall, agenda for the social committee meeting this week. Five parishioners in the hospital, six new mothers who needed help with diapers, blankets, and baby food, a dozen elders who might run short of food this winter. Plus notes he&#x2019;d written on the budget, never his strong point. What was it the provincial said? He ran St. Francis Mission on a hope and a prayer? Some truth in it. His business plan was to make lists of what the mission needed and pray for miracles. The donations always arrived, checks for five, ten, even a hundred dollars from people he had never heard of. <i>Help the Arapahos on the reservation</i> the scribbled notes said.<br><br>He hurried outside and down the concrete steps. The black pickup slowed in front of the Arapaho museum at the far curve of Circle Drive. He broke into a jog along the drive, past the turn off to Eagle Hall and the guest house, past the white stucco church decorated in the blue, red, and yellow geometric symbols of the Arapaho people. It was the third Tuesday in September, the Moon of the Drying Grass, as Arapahos kept time, and the sun was hot, the sky crystal blue. Gravel crunched under his boots and wild grasses in the center of the drive swayed in the wind. He liked autumn best, the trees and brush, the earth itself, engulfed in flames of red, orange, and gold.<br><br>St. Francis Mission on the Wind River Reservation had been home for almost ten years. Still a surprise, when he thought about it. A Boston Irishman, a Jesuit priest on the fast track to an academic career teaching American history at Boston College or Marquette University, at home in the middle of Wyoming on an Indian reservation with a Plains Indian tribe he had only read about in the footnotes of history texts. One day he would be assigned somewhere else, but he was here today.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s door swung open just as he reached the pickup in front of the old gray stone building, the mission school once. The school had closed decades ago, with not enough Jesuits or money to keep it going. A few years ago he had turned the building into a museum of Arapaho history and culture. The wind whistled in the banner stretched over the front porch. Printed in black on a red background were the words: &#x201c;Arapaho Artifacts from Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West. September 21 to January 10.&#x201d;<br><br>Father John leaned down to steady the old man starting to climb out of the pickup. Scuffed boots swung forward and planted themselves on the ground. &#x201c;How are you, Grandfather,&#x201d; he said, using the term of respect for elders.<br><br>Bernard Tallman pushed his Stetson back with the knuckle of an index finger and blinked up at him. He had been tall once, Father John suspected. Bent forward now, shoulders pulled in around him. A hollowed look to his chest. At six feet four, Father John loomed over him as the old man steadied himself. &#x201c;<i>Ni isini</i>,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is a good day. Black Heart&#x2019;s stuff has come home.&#x201d;<br><br>Father John nodded. He held onto the old man&#x2019;s elbow and guided him up the steps and across the porch. An hour ago, he had stood at the window in his office and watched the last delivery truck back up to the porch. Delivery trucks had been arriving all summer, bringing items borrowed from other museums for the Wild West exhibition. This was the most important delivery. Chief Black Heart&#x2019;s regalia that he had worn in the Wild West Show. Two men had unloaded cartons and carried them into the museum, cradling them as if they knew the contents were precious. The phone had rung as the truck headed back out to Seventeen-Mile Road. &#x201c;Artifacts arrived.&#x201d; It was Eldon White Elk, the museum director. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Grandfather.&#x201d;<br><br>The over-sized wooden door, a remnant from the past, like the building itself, swung open. Eldon motioned them inside, nodding and grinning. A row of white teeth flashed against his dark skin. Part Arapaho, part Lakota, the director was at least six feet tall with thick shoulders and arms and a little pouch that hung over his silver belt buckle. He had on blue jeans and a red plaid shirt, cuffs rolled up partway. His hair was black, slicked back into a long ponytail that emphasized his high forehead, sharp cheekbones and hooked nose, the kind of sculptured features that had appeared on posters for the Wild West Show or the Indian nickel.<br><br>&#x201c;Cartons in my office,&#x201d; Eldon said, tilting his head toward the end of the corridor that bisected the building. Rows of doors led into what had once been classrooms but now served as offices and small exhibition areas. Directly across the corridor was the large exhibition hall. &#x201c;Got here just in time. School kids are coming for a preview later today. Let me show you what we&#x2019;ve prepared.&#x201d; He motioned them past the staircase that wound upward to another corridor and still more rooms. Another staircase, Father John knew, had taken students to the third floor dormitory for Arapaho kids who had lived too far out on the rez to walk or ride ponies into school each day. Items from that time were still stored in the basement, he suspected.<br><br>Father John followed Eldon and Bernard into the exhibition hall. Plexiglas display cases wrapped around the walls, a row of low cases ran down the center. The glass surfaces reflected little flares of light. For an instant, Father John felt as if he had stepped back in time and wandered into the Wild West Show itself. A kaleidoscope of colors and motion burst from the display cases. Red, yellow, blue, and black posters of Buffalo Bill leading a charge of cowboys and Indians, horses galloping, dust flying beneath the hooves. The red-printed banners across the top of each poster said Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West. Along the bottom edges were the printed words: &#x201c;Colonel William F. Cody, &#x2018;Buffalo Bill.&#x2019;&#x201d; There were posters of the performers: &#x201c;Johnnie Baker, The Marvelous Marksman,&#x201d; printed in black letters beneath the illustration of a teenaged boy holding a rifle. Another poster illustrated a dark-haired young woman in a fitted jacket filled with medals, one hand on the muzzle of a rifle, the barrel planted on the ground. Black letters said, &#x201c;Miss Annie Oakley, The Peerless Lady Wing-Shot.&#x201d;<br><br>Alongside the posters were buckskin shirts with beaded designs, feathered headdresses, beaded vests and worn cowboy boots with the toes curled up. Bows and arrows, Winchester rifles, silver spurs and belt buckles had been laid out in the middle cases. Arranged around the displays were black-and-white photos of Indians. Show Indians, they had been called. Photos of Indians posing in front of tipis outside an arena, visitors strolling past. A photo of a cavernous canvas tent with &#x201c;Dining Tent&#x201d; scrawled across the bottom and the Wild West train standing on tracks in the background. Another photo of Buffalo Bill himself in a gondola with a group of Indians. &#x201c;Venice,&#x201d; neatly printed along the bottom edge.<br><br>Father John recognized the man and woman on the far side of the hall, peering at what looked like half-empty cases. Sandra Dorris, black-haired and pretty with quick dark eyes, a student at Wyoming Central College who had started working part-time at the museum last spring to help Eldon with the Wild West Show exhibit. Trevor Pratt, stocky, average height with thin, light colored hair that revealed patches of pink scalp as he leaned closer to the display case. Father John knew very little about the man. Two months ago Trevor had walked into his office. Rancher outside Lander, he said. Collector of Indian artifacts. Rare Arapaho artifacts from the Wild West Show that belonged to Chief Black Heart had become available in Berlin, he&#x2019;d said, and he had arranged to purchase the collection. He&#x2019;d heard the museum was planning an exhibit on the Show Indians in Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West. The Arapaho artifacts could be part of the exhibit. He wanted to donate the artifacts to the museum.<br><br>For a moment, Father John hadn&#x2019;t known what to say. It was like the checks that spilled out of envelopes when he most needed them. A little miracle. Arapaho artifacts would be the centerpiece of the exhibit.<br><br>Trevor and Sandra spun around in unison, then Trevor hurried over and took Bernard&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Your grandfather&#x2019;s regalia are safe,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The old man was grinning. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re grateful,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Father John shook Trevor&#x2019;s hand. The man had insisted on remaining anonymous. It was the only condition he had put on the donation.<br><br>&#x201c;Dealer could&#x2019;ve gotten more money,&#x201d; Eldon said, placing a hand on Trevor&#x2019;s shoulder, &#x201c;but Trevor here convinced him the artifacts belonged with the people. The display case is ready.&#x201d; He nodded toward the Plexiglas cases where Trevor and Sandra had been standing. &#x201c;Unbreakable glass, solid locks. Take a bulldozer to remove anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know?&#x201d; Trevor said.<br><br>Eldon stared at the man, as if he could pull the meaning from the words.<br><br>&#x201c;That the dealer could&#x2019;ve gotten more money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Museum gossip.&#x201d; Eldon shrugged. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been a collector long enough to know there aren&#x2019;t many secrets. Show them what we&#x2019;ve planned,&#x201d; he said, facing the young woman.<br><br>Sandra Dorris squared her shoulders, walked back to the display cases and trailed her fingertips over the glass. She had a slight build, almost like a teenager who hadn&#x2019;t yet turned into a woman. Father John followed Bernard over to where she stood. &#x201c;All the other things,&#x201d; she said, gesturing around the hall with one hand, &#x201c;are borrowed from the Cody and other museums. We want to convey a sense of the Wild West Show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Posters are original lithographs,&#x201d; Eldon said, and Father John realized the man was at his shoulder. Trevor Pratt was waiting near the door, arms folded across his chest. &#x201c;Gorgeous, vivid colors. Buffalo Bill knew how to promote a show. Sent people ahead to plaster posters on walls and fences of every city the show visited. Thousands packed the arenas for every performance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We want to showcase the Arapahos in the 1889-1890 season in Europe,&#x201d; Sandra said, tossing Eldon a searching glance for approval. &#x201c;Black Heart&#x2019;s regalia are the highlight, of course.&#x201d; She stopped a moment, as if she had been drawn in by the large, bronze-tinted photograph on the back wall of one of the unfinished display cases. Black Heart staring into the camera with solemn black eyes, dressed in a bone breastplate and eagle-feathered headdress, hands folded in his lap, the dignified pose of a chief.<br><br>Bernard Tallman curled himself closer to the case and gave a respectful nod toward the photo. &#x201c;My father said that Buffalo Bill himself went to the agent in Oklahoma and asked permission to take Arapahos to Europe.&#x201d; He might have been talking to himself, drawing out a memory. &#x201c;Some of the Indians was scared the big ship would fall off the earth at the edge of the water. Grandfather&#x201d;&#x2014;he nodded again toward the photo&#x2014;&#x201c;had gone to England with Buffalo Bill three years before. They put on a show for Queen Victoria herself. He told the other Indians not to be afraid. They&#x2019;d make twenty dollars every month, a lot of money. They&#x2019;d get to see new places and meet different people. They could bring their wives and children. So a lot of Arapahos showed up at the agency, and Buffalo Bill came out and stood on the porch. Didn&#x2019;t say anything, just looked over the faces.&#x201d;<br><br>Bernard straightened up and turned toward Father John. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d been a scout on the plains, you know. He just stood there, like he was waiting for the buffalo to show up. Then he nodded to the Indians he wanted in the show. Put Black Heart in charge because he had experience.&#x201d;<br><br>Scattered on the floor of the display case were smaller black-and-white photos of Indians looking nervous and uncomfortable in front of the camera, as if they were staring into a new and unfathomable world. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll arrange these photos around the regalia,&#x201d; Sandra said. Then she gestured toward the program opened on the floor of the case. Across the top of the right page, in bold, black letters were the words: &#x201c;The Wild West of Buffalo Bill. 1890.&#x201d; &#x201c;This was the show they put on, day after day for almost two years,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Father John leaned down and scanned the program.<i> Entry led by Arrapahoe Indians, their Chief Black Heart. Ogallala Sioux Indians under Chief Rocky Bear, and Cheyennes under Chief Eagle Horn. Horse races. Pony-Express Rider. Indians racing bareback. Buffalo hunt. Shooting exhibitions featuring Annie Oakley and Little Johnnie Baker. Indian camp and dances and foot races. Surprise Indian attack on immigrant wagon train. Indian attack on the Deadwood stagecoach and frontier villages. Buffalo Bill riding to the rescue, galloping and shooting at the same time, cowboys racing alongside.</i><br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll display Black Heart&#x2019;s eagle-feathered headdress here.&#x201d; Sandra waved toward the back of the display case next to the chief&#x2019;s photograph. Father John saw that the elder hadn&#x2019;t taken his eyes from the photograph.<br><br>&#x201c;The other items will go here,&#x201d; Sandra said, nodding toward the adjacent cases. &#x201c;Black Heart&#x2019;s beaded vest and moccasins and armlets, bone breastplate, wrist guards, his red, white, and blue shirt that looks like a flag, beaded leggings, painted pouch and belt and medicine bag. Lance decorated with wrapped cloth and feathers.&#x201d; She tapped at the glass above the clear plastic stands. &#x201c;A dozen pieces altogether.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Every one of them documented by photographs.&#x201d; Eldon stepped forward and put up a hand, like a professor who had been observing a particularly gifted student, but felt there was something he had to add. He rapped the glass above the photos on the display case floor. &#x201c;Here you see Black Heart wearing both the headdress and breastplate. Over here, he has on the moccasins, leggings, and the flag shirt. Here he is on horseback wearing the beaded vest, with pouch and medicine bag attached to his belt. In this photo, he&#x2019;s in the Indian camp next to the arena, and his wristbands are clearly visible.&#x201d;<br><br>Eldon took a couple of steps toward the end of the display case and nodded toward a photo of several Indians standing around Buffalo Bill. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Black Heart on the left, holding his spear. Notice the right wristband. Two rows of beads missing. The wristband in the collection is missing the same two rows.&#x201d; He looked around, the wide grin of achievement creasing his face. &#x201c;The photographs prove not only that the regalia belonged to Black Heart but that he wore them in the Wild West Show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Most things belonged to my grandfather&#x2019;s father,&#x201d; Bernard Tallman said. &#x201c;My ancestor earned every eagle feather in the headdress. Fought the enemy, protected the village. Broke Black Heart&#x2019;s heart, my father told me, when he learned the headdress and all the rest had gone missing.&#x201d;<br><br>The room went quiet a moment, then Eldon said, &#x201c;Your ancestor&#x2019;s possessions are in my office, Grandfather.&#x201d; He nodded the old man into the corridor, and Sandra and Trevor filed out. Father John followed. The director&#x2019;s office was small. Windows framed a view of the Little Wind River and the buffalo herd in a nearby pasture. Cartons stood against the wall below the window. Eldon had already moved a carton to the top of the desk. &#x201c;Please do us the honor, Grandfather,&#x201d; he said, handing the old man a box cutter.<br><br>Bernard Tallman looked shaky, a little off balance as he stepped closer. Father John stayed behind the old man until Bernard had propped himself against the edge of the desk. For a moment he stared at the mass of postage and insurance stickers, the thick brown tape crisscrossing the top, as if the carton were a buffalo he had just brought down and he was about to m...</p><h2>Magical Alphabets: The Secrets and Significance of Ancient Scripts -- Including Runes, Greek, Ogham, Hebrew and Alchemical Alphabets</h2><p>Using the premise that languages and the alphabets that comprise them are metaphorical microcosms of our world, Nigel Pennick demonstrates how various alphabets function as a metaphysical description of reality. Magical alphabets actually enable seekers to experience a transformative process. This inner transformation is one of the main objectives of all esoteric traditions, and it can be accomplished by using any of the alphabet systems described in this book. Pennick&#39;s exciting exploration of Western alphabetical systems includes information about the origins of Hebrew and Greek alphabets, Celtic oghams, and medieval and Renaissance magical and alchemical alphabets. His examination uncovers evidence of the widespread use of runes throughout northern and central Europe, as well as the use of letter systems for operative and ceremonial magic. From grid ciphers to numerology to modern uses, this book provides an in-depth study of the magic present in a tool we use every day-- the alphabet.</p><p></p><h2>The Practice of the Presence of God and The Spiritual Maxims</h2><p>A former soldier, French mystic Nicholas Herman, aka BROTHER LAWRENCE (1611?-1691), was converted to a powerful love of God at age 18 by a humble observation of nature, and his thoughts, collected in these two uncomplicated works of devotion, remain among the most pure and most powerful adorations of the divine. A lay Carmelite brother, Lawrence spent most of his time in the monastery&#39;s kitchens, and his simple, earthy observations on the direct paths to communication with God continue to inspire those seeking a stronger, more potent spirituality today.</p><p>Brother Lawrence: Brother Lawrence was a seventeenth-century French monk who in his monastery kitchen discovered an overwhelming delight in God&#39;s presence.This new edition is helpful to the average reader because it situates Lawrence...within the historical context of his times. But its greatest benefit for such readers is that it provides them with a fresh, readable translation of a classic of Christian literature. --Wendy M. Wright, Weavings<br><br>This faithfully translated new edition is the most complete and comprehensive text on Brother Lawrence available. --Gerald E. May, M.D., from the Foreword<br><br>...'[This book] has opened up the personal interconnections within the movement as never before.' --unknown</p><h2>Steward Leadership in the Nonprofit Organization</h2><p>Most approaches to nonprofit organizational leadership are borrowed from the for-profit sector. But these models are often inadequate to address the issues nonprofit leaders face. We need a new framework for nonprofit management that is rooted in historical precedent and biblical principles yet is also appropriate for the nonprofit context. Nonprofit consultant and researcher Kent Wilson presents a comprehensive model for steward leadership, in which leaders act as stewards or trustees, never as owners. Scripture and history give concrete examples of stewards who manage resources on behalf of others for the good of others. Wilson applies this classical understanding of the steward to modern organizational management, defining and developing steward leadership as an alternative to its cousin, servant leadership. Steward leadership offers great hope for the transformation and effectiveness of nonprofit leadership for stakeholders, board members, executive directors and staff members. Designed by a nonprofit leader for nonprofit leaders, this fresh approach to leadership gives you a new focus to lead your organization with excellence.</p><p>Kent R. Wilson (d. 2017) was a business practitioner and leadership specialist. He was the cofounder of Steward Leadership Initiative and served as the national program director for Christian Leadership Alliance's Leader2Leader program. After running for-profit and nonprofit companies for thirty years, Wilson mentored and coached CEOs as an executive coach with Vistage International and the Nonprofit Leadership Exchange in Colorado Springs. He is a contributor to the <em>NIV Stewardship Study Bible</em> and taught entrepreneurial business skills internationally as a volunteer trainer for three international business-as-mission organizations."What I most appreciate about Wilson's explanation of the steward leadership model is his motivation, which seems to be authentically grounded in biblical principles. He wisely and carefully warns leaders against the slippery slope of an ownership mentality, an exhortation that leaders in Jesus' church, regardless of position or role, should eagerly heed." (John Davidson, Influence Magazine, August 30, 2016)<br><br>"Kent Wilson provides a fresh look at steward leadership through the eyes of an experienced nonprofit CEO and the lens of a biblical worldview. <em>Steward Leadership in the Nonprofit Organization</em> is a thoughtful developmental guide for any leader." (Al Lopus, president and cofounder, Best Christian Workplaces Institute)<br><br>"When God interrupted my life as a church pastor and called me to found and lead a nonprofit organization ten years ago, I really could have used this book. Rather than borrowing spiritual concepts to buttress popular leadership theory, Kent Wilson mines Scripture and uncovers a fresh perspective on leadership&#x2015;the leader as steward. This is the basic primer every Christian executive and pastor needs to read, digest, and read again!" (Mike Johnson, founder and president, Ascending Leaders)<br><br>"This astute historical sketch of the steward from antiquity positions modern readers to grasp the gravity of biblical passages with the steward in view. I especially appreciated the use of ancient quotes, theological principles, contrasting charts, and call-out boxes that illustrated key points. In a time when too many Christians are acting like owners, Kent Wilson does more than map a model of the steward leader for readers, he shows us how to recalibrate the compass of our spiritual lives and steward leadership toward faithfulness to our master and Lord, Jesus Christ. Well done!" (Gary G. Hoag, Generosity Monk, press author and international liaison, ECFA)<br><br>"An essential read for anyone involved or interested in leadership. From his practical experience and Christian reflection, Kent Wilson uncovers the foundational importance of the biblical metaphor of stewardship, develops the contribution of earlier writers on the subject, from Peter Block to Scott Rodin, and applies his findings to the work of nonprofit organizations. On the way he provides case studies of steward leadership in practice, examines the relationship between steward and servant leadership models, and clarifies the roles of board, executive and staff members. Overall, a major contribution." (Robert Banks, Centre for the History of Christian Thought Experience, Macquarie University, Sydney)<br><br>"Kent Wilson is the right person to address the concept of stewardship. Kent is a practitioner! As the head of a family foundation, a leader in the nonprofit world and an international contributor to the nonprofit enterprise, Kent speaks with 'battle smoke' on every concept! I have watched Kent practice what he presents for over twenty years. That's why I'm ordering a copy for every member of the TWR International Leadership Team." (Lauren Libby, international president and CEO, TWR International)<br><br>"Dr. Kent Wilson presents rich historical and biblical context for why steward leadership is essential in order for nonprofit ministries to thrive. He's done the research and supports his case beautifully with compelling stories of steward leaders who have embraced these principles in how they live and lead. Discover everything you need to alter your thinking and transform your heart as a leader." (Tami Heim, president and CEO, Christian Leadership Alliance)<br><br>"We are indebted to Kent for this thorough presentation of the uniqueness of the steward leader for nonprofit organizations. His historical survey, biblical foundation and the chapters on the nonprofit board as steward leaders and the nonprofit staff as stewards are especially welcome additions to the field of steward leader studies." (R. Scott Rodin, author of The Steward Leader)</p><h2>Nothing More to Lose (NYRB Poets)</h2><p><i>Nothing More to Lose</i> is the first collection of poems by Palestinian poet Najwan Darwish to appear in English. Hailed across the Arab world&nbsp; and beyond, Darwish&#x2019;s poetry walks the razor&#x2019;s edge between despair and resistance, between dark humor and harsh political realities. With incisive imagery and passionate lyricism, Darwish confronts themes of equality and justice while offering a radical, more inclusive, rewriting of what it means to be both Arab and Palestinian living in Jerusalem, his birthplace.</p><p><b>Najwan Darwish</b>, one of the foremost Arabic-language poets of his generation, was born in Jerusalem in 1978, exactly thirty years after his family was exiled from their home in the western part of the city. Shortly after studying in Amman, Jordan, and becoming a lawyer, Darwish decided to give up law and devote himself more fully to literature. He has worked as the editor of two cultural magazines in Palestine and was a cultural critic for the prominent Lebanese newspaper<i> Al-Akhbar</i> from 2006 to 2012. Darwish has been an organizer and advisor for many public arts projects, among them the Palestine Festival of Literature. In 2009, he founded a literary press in Jerusalem, and he is currently involved in establishing a new pan-Arab newspaper, where he will be the chief editor of the arts and culture section. Darwish&#x2019;s poetry is informed by Arabic and Western poetic traditions, both classical and modern, as well as by Persian Sufi poetry. Since the publication of his first collection in 2000, his poetry has been acclaimed across the Arab world and has been translated into fifteen languages. In 2009 he was on the Hay Festival Beirut&#x2019;s list of the &#x201c;best 39 Arab authors under the age of 39.&#x201d; He currently resides in Jerusalem.<br><br><b>Kareem James Abu-Zeid</b> was born in 1981. Half American and half Egyptian, he has translated novels by the Lebanese writer Rabee Jaber and the Sudanese writer Tarek Eltayeb, as well the poetry collection <i>The Iraqi Nights</i> by Dunya Mikhail. Abu-Zeid also translates from French and German, and has taught university courses in four different languages in Berkeley, Mannheim, and Heidelberg. He works as a freelance translator and editor, and is currently writing a history of psychedelic literature that is doubling as his PhD dissertation in comparative literature at the University of California Berkeley."Roughly halfway through Najwan Darwish&#x2019;s <i>Nothing More to Lose</i>, wiping awkwardly at tears and trying self-consciously not to sob with my partner in the room, I found myself wondering what someone with no connection to Palestine would make of it...Here is what I think they would find: a collection of very short poems &#x2014; often no more than a page &#x2014; speaking of love, sorrow, loss, hope and despair in a voice simultaneously so passionate and so matter-of-fact that it stops the breath." &#x2014;NPR Books<br><br>&#x201c;Readers may presume that writers faced with the immediate realities of life under occupation are limited by the attendant tropes of rage and despair, or else flee into sentimentality or aesthetics. Najwan Darwish&#x2019;s poetry is different. Constrained by neither temporality nor place, his poetry is a medium of defiance, employing a sharp wit to illuminate absurdities and injustices. Darwish&#x2019;s poetry renders the particularity of the Palestinian experience in luminous imagery and piercing obser-vations, but his imagination and interests are not limited by borders.&#x201d; &#x2014;Emily Dische-Becker, Poetry International<br><br>&#x201c;One of the most exciting young voices in the Arab world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nathalie Handal<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Najwan Darwish&#x2019;s poetry is different: it seems to have overcome the false dichotomy between poetry and social and political reality. What struck me first about reading these poems is his capacity to do justice to both poetry (to image, to condensed form) while also doing justice to its surrounding reality. This is a significant challenge: how to mediate between two intense forms without ruining either.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bashir Abu-Manneh, Barnard College<br><br>&#x201c;The poems...are passionately lyrical, and their imagery is acutely effective....an invitation to learn lessons from history and to know that in the end there is victory for those who persevere, those who may have been forgotten but whose courageous deeds lived to create better lives for future generations.&#x201d; &#x2014;Issa J.

First, her friend Serena, the captain of the swim team, drowns mysteriously in the middle of a calm lake. Then, one year later, mountain lions are spotted rather frequently around Maya's home&#x2014;and her reactions to them are somewhat . . . unexpected. Her best friend, Daniel, has also been experiencing unexplainable premonitions about certain people and situations.</p><p>It doesn't help that the new bad boy in town, Rafe, has a dangerous secret, and he's interested in one special part of Maya's anatomy&#x2014;her paw-print birthmark.</p></p><p><p>When librarians finally granted Kelley Armstrong an adult card, she made straight for the epic fantasy and horror shelves. She spent the rest of her childhood and teen years happily roaming fantastical and terrible worlds, and vowed that someday she'd write a story combining swords, sorcery, and the ravenous undead. That story began with the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Sea of Shadows</em> and continues with <em>Empire of Night</em>.</p><p>Armstrong's first works for teens were the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Darkest Powers and Darkness Rising trilogies. She lives in rural Ontario with her husband, three children, and far too many pets.</p>SERENA STOOD ON THE rock ledge twenty feet above the lake, singing in a voice known to bring tears to the eyes of everyone who heard it. Everyone except me. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Seri,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;just dive already.&#x201d; Serena stuck out her tongue and shifted closer to the edge, toes wrapping around it. She bounced there, blond ponytail bobbing, cheeks puffing. Then she dove. It was, as usual, an effort worthy of the Olympics, and she sliced into the water so smoothly that barely a ripple pinged across the glassy surface.<br>&nbsp;<br>She popped back up, sleek as a seal. &#x201c;Your turn, Maya!&#x201d; I flipped her the finger. She laughed and dove again. Serena was the swimmer&#x2014;captain of the school team. It&#x2019;s not my thing, really. This was the part I liked, just sitting on the rock ledge, bare feet dangling. I basked in the morning sun, drinking in the rich, late-summer air and the perfect view of the crystal-clear lake, the distant snow-capped mountains, the endless evergreens.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Serena swam to the middle of the lake, I squinted over at the path, looking for a familiar blond head. Daniel was supposed to join us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daniel and I had been friends since I&#x2019;d moved to Salmon Creek when I was five. Then, last year, there&#x2019;d been a school dance where the girls were supposed to invite the guys, and Serena thought we should draw straws to see who asked Daniel. I liked him, but not the way Serena did, so I&#x2019;d fixed the game so she&#x2019;d win. They&#x2019;d been together ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Serena swam back toward me, I stripped to my bra and panties, dropping my clothes into the bushes below.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ooh la la,&#x201d; she called. &#x201c;Check out the new undies. Did some amazing friend finally take pity and buy you grown-up stuff?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, and she&#x2019;d better be right about them not going seethrough when they get wet. Otherwise her boyfriend is going to see a lot more of me than she&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Serena laughed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be fine. White&#x2019;s your color. Shows off your tan.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head at her and plaited my long black hair. I don&#x2019;t have a tan. I&#x2019;m Native. Navajo, maybe. I&#x2019;d been adopted as a baby and my mother hadn&#x2019;t been around to fill in any background forms.<br>&nbsp;<br>I climbed farther up the rocks and stopped at one overhanging the lake.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I balanced there, Serena called, &#x201c;Hey, those low riders show off your birthmark. Did you ask your parents about getting that tattoo?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My fingers dropped to the mark on my hip. It looked like a faded paw print, and I wanted to get it tattooed so it would show up better.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mom says maybe when I&#x2019;m sixteen. Dad says when I&#x2019;m sixty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come around.&#x201d; She flipped onto her back and floated. &#x201c;He always does. You should do it for your sixteenth birthday next year. We&#x2019;ll get your mom to take us over to Vancouver, make a weekend of it. I&#x2019;ll get one, too. I want a nightingale, right over my boob, so when I get up on stage in my sexy dress, cut down to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She flailed suddenly. &#x201c;Maya!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She went under. Disappeared completely, like a hook had dragged her down.<br>&nbsp;<br>I jumped into the water, and I hit it wrong. Pain smacked me so hard I gasped. Water filled my mouth and my nose. I swam out in a frantic dog paddle. I could see the rings where Serena had gone under. They seemed to get farther away with every clumsy stroke I took.<br>&nbsp;<br>I treaded water, looking around. &#x201c;Serena?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If this is a prank to get me in the lake, it worked,&#x201d; I said, my voice quavering.<br>&nbsp;<br>When she didn&#x2019;t reply, I dove. As I went under, panic hit, like it always did&#x2014;my gut telling me this was wrong, dangerous, get above the surface or I&#x2019;d drown.<br>&nbsp;<br>The normally clear lake was brown, churned up dirt swirling through it, and I couldn&#x2019;t see.<br>&nbsp;<br>I shot up from the water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Help!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Someone! Please!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I dove again, blind and flailing, praying my hand or foot would brush Serena.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;s been under too long.<br>&nbsp;<br>No, she hadn&#x2019;t. Serena could hold her breath forever. Last year, we&#x2019;d timed her at a swim meet and she&#x2019;d stayed under for five minutes before the coach ran over and made her stop. I couldn&#x2019;t hold my breath even for a minute. I bobbed up again, gasping.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maya!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I followed the shout to the shore. The sun glinted off the wet rocks and I blinked. Then I glimpsed blond wavy hair and a flash of tanned skin as Daniel yanked off his shirt.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Serena,&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;She went und&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My kicking leg caught on something. I tried to pull, but it tightened around my ankle. I went under, screaming. Water filled my mouth as it closed over my head.<br>&nbsp;<br>I fought, kicking and twisting, trying to grab at whatever had me. My fingers brushed something soft, and my brain screamed &#x201c;Serena!&#x201d; I tried to grab her, but I was dragged deeper and deeper until my feet hit the bottom. Then, whatever was wrapped around my ankle fell away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I pushed up through the murky water. But as soon as my feet left the lake bottom, I couldn&#x2019;t tell where the surface was anymore. Everything was dark. My lungs burned. My head throbbed. I kept fighting my way up. Oh God, let it be up. Finally I broke through. I felt the sunlight and the slap of cool air, only to go back down again. I pushed up, but couldn&#x2019;t stay afloat, couldn&#x2019;t seem to remember how to tread water. My whole body ached. Staying above was such a struggle, it was almost a relief when the water closed over my head again, peaceful silence enveloping me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I had to struggle not to give in, had to force my arms and legs to keep churning, get my head back above&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Arms grabbed me. They seemed to be pulling me under and I struggled against them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maya!&#x201d; Daniel shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t care. I needed him to let go of me, leave me be, let me breathe. He gripped me tighter, wrapping one strong arm around me as he swam.<br>&nbsp;<br>I told Daniel to let me go, that I could make it to shore, just find Serena, please find Serena. He thought I was still panicking and kept hauling me along until, finally, he heaved me onto the rocks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Serena,&#x201d; I gasped. &#x201c;Get Serena.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He hoisted himself up and scanned the shore and I realized he hadn&#x2019;t understood. Oh God, he hadn&#x2019;t heard me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Serena!&#x201d; I yelled. &#x201c;She went under. I was trying to find her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His eyes widened. He twisted and plunged into the lake. I huddled there on a rock, coughing, as he swam out. I watched him dive and come back up. Dive and come back up. Dive and come back up . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>They dragged the lake that afternoon and found Serena&#x2019;s body. Her death was ruled an accidental drowning. A healthy teenage girl, captain of the swim team, had drowned. No one knew how it happened. An undertow. A cramp. A freak panic attack. There were plenty of guesses but no answers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon all that was left of Serena was a monument in the school yard. The town moved on. I didn&#x2019;t. Something had happened in that lake, something I couldn&#x2019;t explain. But I would. One day, I would.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Clean and White: A History of Environmental Racism in the United States</h2><p><p><b>Clean and White offers a history of environmental racism in the United States focusing on constructions of race and hygiene.</b></p><p>When Joe Biden attempted to compliment Barack Obama by calling him &#x201c;clean and articulate,&#x201d; he unwittingly tapped into one of the most destructive racial stereotypes in American history. This book tells the history of the corrosive idea that whites are clean and those who are not white are dirty. From the age of Thomas Jefferson to the Memphis Public Workers strike of 1968 through the present day, ideas about race and waste have shaped where people have lived, where people have worked, and how American society&#x2019;s wastes have been managed. </p><p>In the wake of the civil war, as the nation encountered emancipation, mass immigration, and the growth of an urbanized society, Americans began to conflate the ideas of race and waste. Certain immigrant groups took on waste management labor, such as Jews and scrap metal recycling, fostering connections between the socially marginalized and refuse. Ethnic &#x201c;purity&#x201d; was tied to pure cleanliness, and hygiene became a central aspect of white identity. </p><p>Carl A. Zimring here draws on historical evidence from statesmen, scholars, sanitarians, novelists, activists, advertisements, and the United States Census of Population to reveal changing constructions of environmental racism. The material consequences of these attitudes endured and expanded through the twentieth century, shaping waste management systems and environmental inequalities that endure into the twenty-first century. Today, the bigoted idea that non-whites are &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; remains deeply ingrained in the national psyche, continuing to shape social and environmental inequalities in the age of Obama.</p></p><p><b>Carl A. Zimring</b> is Professor of Sustainability Studies in the Department of Social Science and Cultural Studies at the Pratt Institute.

With deft prose and thoroughly researched arguments, Zimring unravels some of the previously overlooked origins of deeply rooted American racism, and in the process shows how these have come to justify economic, social, and political discrimination against people of color. It is an important original analysis, and it brings much needed insight to our ongoing national debate about race and justice."<i>-Robin Nagle, author of Picking Up: On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New Yor</i><br><br>"[E]nlightening."<i>-</i><i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Zimring offers a clearly written overview of environmental racism in the US."<i>-Choice Connect</i><br><br>"What an innovative study! In Clean and White, Carl Zimring addresses an age-old critique of racism that posits white as clean and good and black as dirty and bad. In so doing, he elevates the discussion by demonstrating the cultural roots of this nefarious comparison within the context of environmental racism.

But only in the beginning. After the opening act of the great national drama, Native Americans yielded to the westward rush of European settlers. </p><p> Or so the story usually goes. Yet, for three centuries after Columbus, Native people controlled most of eastern North America and profoundly shaped its destiny. In <i>Facing East from Indian Country</i>, Daniel K. Richter keeps Native people center-stage throughout the story of the origins of the United States. </p><p> Viewed from Indian country, the sixteenth century was an era in which Native people discovered Europeans and struggled to make sense of a new world. Well into the seventeenth century, the most profound challenges to Indian life came less from the arrival of a relative handful of European colonists than from the biological, economic, and environmental forces the newcomers unleashed. Drawing upon their own traditions, Indian communities reinvented themselves and carved out a place in a world dominated by transatlantic European empires. In 1776, however, when some of Britain's colonists rebelled against that imperial world, they overturned the system that had made Euro-American and Native coexistence possible. Eastern North America only ceased to be an Indian country because the revolutionaries denied the continent's first peoples a place in the nation they were creating. </p><p> In rediscovering early America as Indian country, Richter employs the historian's craft to challenge cherished assumptions about times and places we thought we knew well, revealing Native American experiences at the core of the nation's birth and identity. </p></p><p><b>Daniel K. Richter</b> is Director of The McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and the author of <i>The Ordeal of the Longhouse</i>.Richter here offers a masterly work that eschews the long-standing perception that Native Americans were nothing more than marginalized bystanders as Europeans colonized North America. Focusing on the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, the author instead shows that Native American communities adapted to the many stresses introduced by the arrival of the Europeans and were active participants in creating a new way of life on the continent...[He] provides a valuable perspective that is often overlooked in books about the same period. Highly recommended for all public and academic libraries. (John Burch <i>Library Journal</i> 2001-10-15)<br><br>At the center of this bold and thoroughly astonishing history of Native Americans are narratives of three Indians generally known to Euro-Americans: Pocahontas, Blessed Catherine Tekakwitha, and the Algonquin warrior Metacom, also known as King Philip. Telling each of these stories--a romance, the life of a saint, the destruction of a 'noble savage'--from the European and then the Native American perspective, Richter elucidates an alternative history of America from Columbus to just after the Revolution...Gracefully written and argued, Richter's compelling research and provocative claims make this an important addition to the literature for general readers of both Native American and U.S. studies. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2001-10-22)<br><br>Most American histories treat North America's indigenous peoples as ancillary to the more important story of the establishment of a European nation in the New World. What would happen if one shifted focus and transformed the usual bit-players into stars? Richter...makes that shift and produces what may, for its impeccable use of primary sources, smoothly well-wrought prose, and passionate argument, become a classic. (Patricia Monaghan <i>Booklist</i> 2001-11-15)<br><br>An excellent, ambitious attempt to restore to history long-overlooked Indians who 'neither uncompromisingly resisted...nor wholeheartedly assimilated' in the face of white encroachment...A hallmark in recent Native American historiography that merits wide attention. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2001-09-15)<br><br>Richter demythicizes the standard accounts...to demonstrate how white settlers consciously created false images to justify economic, religious, and military exploitation of Native inhabitants...This [is an] innovative and well-written book. (M. L. Tate <i>Choice</i> 2002-06-01)<br><br>Richter insists that we must look over the shoulders of American Indians to see the Europeans who settled the New World to have a complete understanding of our origins. His depiction of how these original Americans adapted to the new-comers and how they were inevitably betrayed by generations devoted to "freedom" and "opportunity" are especially telling. (<i>Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News</i> 2002-07-28)<br><br>In his acclaimed volume <i>Facing East From Indian Country</i>, Daniel Richter turns the tables on 'conventional' histories of early European-Indian relations by looking east from the Mississippi River rather than west from the Atlantic Ocean...Richter approaches, from the Indian perspective, the history of early contact with Europeans through the founding of the U. S., with emphasis on tribes' immeasurable contribution to the history of the continent. He culls Native voices from surviving documents and records, pulling Indians from the periphery of white America's memory and making them the focal point of the post-contact story. (Tom Wanamaker <i>Indian Country Today</i> 2003-09-24)<br><br>[Richter] has written a provocative new interpretation of early America from pre-contact to the early 19th century...[H]e places early America in the context of Native American society and history and not solely in the rush of colonial expansion...Historians of the American West and scholars of Western Native American studies will find much value in Richter's retelling of early American History.

No single factor is responsible for children's acquisition of literacy skills or for their failure; rather, a variety of factors contributes to children's literacy development. The following section presents the most salient of these factors. The model of reading set forth in this text, known as the Component Model of Reading, is useful for organizing the factors that influence the acquisition of literacy skills into a coherent format. The theoretical framework on which this reading model is based is derived from the following works: Aaron, 1995; Aaron, 1997; Aaron and Kotva, 1999; Gough and Tunmer, 1986; and Joshi and Aaron, 2000.</p><b>The Component Model of Reading</b><br><p>In the context of this reading model, a component is defined as an elementary and independent process that operates on other internal cognitive processes (Sternberg, 1985). What qualifies a cognitive process as a component is its elemental nature and its independence from other mental processes. An example of an elementary operation of the reading process is decoding written words. The independent status of a process can be evaluated by subjecting it to the criterion of double dissociation. One analogy that can be used to explain the dissociation concept is the functioning of the automobile, which has several components: the fuel system, the electrical system, the transmission system, and so on. Each of these components is independent from the other components because one of these components can break down, leaving the others intact. When a component, regardless of what it is, fails to function normally, the automobile is disabled. Likewise, a child will read poorly if any of the components of reading, such as decoding or comprehension, fails to develop typically.</p><p>There is overall agreement that at the cognitive level, reading is made up of at least two components: decoding and linguistic comprehension. Fluency, or speed of reading, is claimed by some researchers to be yet another component, but its independent status is not clearly established. The implications of the componential nature of reading is that one component can develop at a typical rate while the other component, independent of the first, lags behind. For example, a child might fail to develop optimal decoding skills yet show typical listening comprehension skill; another child's decoding skills might develop typically but listening comprehension may lag. As a result, there are four different kinds of readers: those who have impaired decoding skills but typical linguistic comprehension; those who have typical decoding skills but poor linguistic comprehension; those who have impairments in both decoding and comprehension skills; and those who have satisfactory decoding and comprehension skills. Apart from these cognitive factors, there are also extrinsic factors that can hold back the acquisition of literacy skills. Factors influencing the acquisition of literacy skills are organized into three domains within the Component Model. These three domains are<br></p><ol><li> The cognitive domain<br></li><li> The psychological domain<br></li><li> The ecological domain<p></p></li></ol><p>Although the cognitive domain satisfies the two requirements of a component&#x2014;elemental nature and independence from other cognitive processes&#x2014;the other two domains do not satisfy these requirements nearly as well. Nevertheless, the Component Model provides a framework for teachers to navigate their course through various assessment decisions and meet the instructional needs of the children in their classroom. The Component Model is used here as a means of coherently organizing the several factors that affect literacy development. The important thing to remember is that students can fail to acquire satisfactory levels of literacy skills because of deficiency in any component in one of these three domains. It follows, then, that in order to enable students to attain satisfactory literacy skills, the deficient area must first be identified and then remedial instruction targeting the deficient area implemented. Astudy by Catts, Hogan, and Fey (2003) demonstrated the success of such an approach. The three domains of the Component Model of Reading and their constituent components are shown in Figure 1.1.</p><b>The Cognitive Domain</b><br><p>The initial idea of the componential nature of reading comes from a proposal by Gough and Tunmer (1986) in the form of a simple mathematical formula:<br><br> RC = D _ LC<br><br> RC = reading comprehension, D = decoding of the printed word, and LC = linguistic comprehension (in this case, listening comprehension). This means that decoding and comprehension are two components of the cognitive module of reading. According to Gough and Tunmer, if D = 0, then RC = 0. Likewise, if LC = 0, RC = 0. That is, if a child's decoding skill is zero, his or her reading comprehension is zero; if a child's listening comprehension is zero, his or her reading comprehension is also zero. In other words, a child who cannot decode the printed word cannot read and understand, and a child who cannot listen and understand also cannot read and understand. The model formula as used in this textbook is slightly modified from the one shown above. The modified formula is RC = WR _ LC, where RC = reading comprehension, WR = word recognition, and LC = listening comprehension. The difference between the modified formula and the original one proposed by Gough and Tunmer is that <b>word recognition</b> replaces <b>decoding.</b></p><b>Word Recognition</b><p>Word recognition (WR) is made up of two subprocesses: decoding and instant word reading (sight word reading). After a child's decoding skills reach a certain level, recognition of familiar words becomes fast and automatic, a skill also referred to as sight word reading. This text uses the term <i>instant word reading</i> instead of <i>sight word reading</i> because the latter term implies that visual processes are mainly responsible for quick recognition of the written word. However, studies show that phonological skills play a major role in decoding, which is a precursor to instant word reading (Ehri, 1998). In other words, whereas a few words can be read by using visual memory, a large sight vocabulary depends on well&#x2013;developed decoding skills. Visual memory has a limited capacity, perhaps not exceeding a few hundred words, yet a mature reader can recognize more than 80,000 words instantly. Obviously, the instant recognition of this many words cannot be accomplished by visual memory alone.</p><b>Comprehension</b><p><i>Comprehension</i> is a generic term that includes both listening comprehension and reading comprehension. Studies have shown that these two types of comprehension are highly correlated and that they are mediated by the same cognitive mechanisms (Jahandire, 1999).</p><p>The validity of the original simple view of reading was demonstrated by Hoover and Gough (1990) in a study of 254 bilingual (English&#x2013;Spanish) elementary school children. The investigators found that a substantial proportion of the <b>variance</b> in reading comprehension was accounted for by the product of decoding and listening comprehension (first grade, 71%; second grade, 72%; third grade, 83%; fourth grade, 82%). Subsequent studies by other researchers showed that decoding and listening comprehension do not make an equal contribution to reading comprehension at all grade levels; decoding makes a greater contribution in first and second grades, whereas comprehension makes a greater contribution in the upper grades (Rupley, Willson, &amp; Nichols, 1998).</p><b>Independence of Word Recognition and Comprehension</b><p>The independence of word recognition and comprehension is also supported by studies from neuropsychology (Marshall &amp; Newcombe, 1973) and developmental psychology (Frith &amp; Snowling, 1983). For instance, in Marshall and Newcombe's study, some patients with stroke misread the word <i>father</i> as "dad" and <i>garden</i> as "flower," which indicated that their comprehension was relatively intact but that their decoding skills were impaired. The converse pattern was seen in other patients, who tended to pronounce words mechanically but failed to comprehend their meaning. For example, these patients read the word <i>sale</i> as "Sally" and <i>listen</i> as "Liston." When asked what these words meant, they answered that it was the name of a girl and the name of a boxer, respectively, which indicated that they could pronounce the written words&#x2014;albeit mechanically&#x2014;but that their comprehension of these words was impaired.</p><p>Likewise, developmental studies have shown that the ability to pronounce written words is independent of the ability to comprehend their meaning. Frith and Snowling (1983), for instance, described two kinds of poor readers: children with average or above average IQ who can understand spoken language quite well but have difficulty with written language (i.e., dyslexia) and some children with <b>autism</b> who are precocious readers and can sound out written words but cannot comprehend well what they have read (i.e., hyperlexia; see Box 1.1). Hyperlexia and dyslexia are often considered to occupy opposite poles of reading difficulty. Thus, these two conditions show that reading difficulties can arise for different reasons.</p><p>In addition to this evidence, recently conducted neuroimaging studies show that decoding and comprehension tasks activate different parts of the brain, indicating that there are separate neurological substrates for decoding and comprehension processes (Shaywitz, Mody, &amp; Shaywitz, 2006). What is relevant from an educational perspective is that assessment of the components of cognitive domain and instruction that targeted the weak component produces improvement in children's literacy skills (Aaron, 1995; Aaron, 1997; Aaron, Joshi, Boulware&#x2013;Gooden, &amp; Bentum, in press; Aaron &amp; Kotva, 1999; Joshi &amp; Aaron, 2000).</p><p>Data from genetic studies also add to the evidence that word recognition and comprehension are independent processes. Keenan, Betjemann, Wadsworth, DeFries, and Olson (2006) reported that their genetic study of dyslexia in identical and fraternal twins showed that there is substantial and significant genetic influence on individual differences in both reading and listening comprehension. In this study, word recognition and listening comprehension each accounted for significant, independent genetic influences on reading comprehension. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, reading fluency and vocabulary knowledge are two important correlates of reading skills. Nevertheless, they are not accorded status as components in the Component Model of Reading.</p><b>Box 1.1. The syndrome of hyperlexia</b><p>The <b>syndrome</b> of hyperlexia is a developmental disability in which children show extraordinary word recognition skill in conjunction with very poor comprehension. Hyperlexia is marked by three features: 1) learning to read words at 3 or 4 years of age in the absence of formal instruction, 2) exhibiting compulsive behavior and rituals when reading words, and 3) comprehending both written and spoken language very poorly. Frequently, but not always, this condition is associated with autism.</p><p>There are also some precocious children who can decode written material very well and also comprehend it quite well. Teachers should be careful not to mistake these precocious readers as having hyperlexia. Hyperlexia is marked by extreme deficiency in comprehension of both spoken and written language, and for this reason, very young children with good decoding skills should have their comprehension assessed. As with dyslexia, hyperlexia can vary in severity.</p><b>Fluency</b><p>As noted previously, some researchers consider the speed with which written words are named, known as fluency (a correlate of instant word reading), to be a factor independent of decoding skill (e.g., Bowers &amp; Newby&#x2013;Clark, 2002; Wolf, Goldberg, Cirino, Morris, &amp; Lovett, 2002). Although the importance of speed of processing information is well recognized, its independent nature has not been settled. In a recent study that analyzed data collected from more than a thousand 5&#x2013; to 10&#x2013;year&#x2013;old children, Konold, Juel, McKinnon, and Deffes (2003) reported that <b>processing speed,</b> along with vocabulary knowledge, made independent contributions to reading. However, other studies have indicated that speed of processing contributes only a negligible amount of independent variance to reading comprehension. This likely is so because instant word recognition is closely associated with reading speed, and instant word recognition is accomplished by processing the written word automatically and at a very fast rate (Adlof, Catts, Hogan, &amp; Little, 2005; Cho &amp; McBride&#x2013;Chang, 2005; Hawelka &amp; Wimmer, 2005). This makes it difficult to separate reading speed from instant word recognition ability and assign speed an independent status. For instance, can a child who is a fluent reader be a poor decoder? Conversely, can a child who is a poor decoder be a fluent reader? Neither possibility is likely. Vukovic and Siegel (2005) investigated the independent nature of fluency and concluded that the existence of poor readers who are deficient in naming speed but not in decoding has not been documented. This means that fluency marks a stage in which the reader has developed from a plodding decoder into a swift instant word recognizer. Instant word recognition and speed of reading, therefore, are not treated as two different components in the Component Model. So, what is the final word on fluency? When children begin to read, they tend to focus on letters and <b>syllables</b> rather than on words in order to decode. By about the third grade, they are able to process bigger chunks of words and identify words instantly and automatically. Once children become instant word readers, they become fluent readers. When they reach this phase, they do not have to invest attention in decoding words but can focus on the meaning of the text. The ability to read words instantly and effortlessly, therefore, is a prerequisite for good reading comprehension. In one study, Vaessen, Gerretsen, and Blomert (2007) studied Dutch children in order to evaluate the "double&#x2013;deficit <b>hypothesis,"</b> which states that poor readers have deficits in two different areas: decoding and naming speed. After testing 162 children with dyslexia, the investigators found that nearly 90% of the slow readers also had decoding difficulties and concluded their results do not support the double&#x2013;deficit hypothesis.</p><p>The results of the previously mentioned studies should not be taken to mean that speed of processing is unimportant. The fact that fluency...</p></p><h2>Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-worship</h2><p>A trenchant analysis of modern physchology&#x2014;an enterprise that Paul Vitz maintains has become a religion, a secular cult of self, now part of the problem of modern life rather than part of its resolution.

He describes the architecture of space and time, dark matter and dark energy, how galaxies form, why stars implode, how everything began, and how it's all going to end. He considers parallel universes, the fine-tuning of the cosmos for life, what forms extraterrestrial life might take, and the likelihood of life on Earth being snuffed out by an asteroid. <br>Beginning with the Babylonian integration of mathematics into the study of astronomy and cosmology, Stewart traces the evolution of our understanding of the cosmos: How Kepler's laws of planetary motion led Newton to formulate his theory of gravity. How, two centuries later, tiny irregularities in the motion of Mars inspired Einstein to devise his general theory of relativity. How, eighty years ago, the discovery that the universe is expanding led to the development of the Big Bang theory of its origins. How single-point origin and expansion led cosmologists to theorize new components of the universe, such as inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. But does inflation explain the structure of today's universe? Does dark matter actually exist? Could a scientific revolution that will challenge the long-held scientific orthodoxy and once again transform our understanding of the universe be on the way?

Complementing the excellent reproductions are more than serviceable introductory essays, which underline the role of the Medici in originally shaping the collections and providing perceptive insights into the stylistic epochs and artistic personalities encompassed by these stellar repositories. The individual paintings are adequately identified and tersely discussed in terms of dating and acquisition. Although not as lavish in the quantity or the scale of their illustration, Caterina Caneva and others' The Uffizi: Guide to the Collections and Catalogue of All Paintings and Pitti Palace: Guide to the Collections and Complete Catalogue of the Palatine Gallery (both LJ 5/15/93) permit the less affluent general collection an attractive, if less spectacular, admission to these universes of pictorial genius.<br><i>Robert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Politics of Retribution in Europe</h2><p><p>The presentation of Europe's immediate historical past has quite dramatically changed. Conventional depictions of occupation and collaboration in World War II, of wartime resistance and post-war renewal, provided the familiar backdrop against which the chronicle of post-war Europe has mostly been told. Within these often ritualistic presentations, it was possible to conceal the fact that not only were the majority of people in Hitler's Europe not resistance fighters but millions actively co-operated with and many millions more rather easily accommodated to Nazi rule. Moreover, after the war, those who judged former collaborators were sometimes themselves former collaborators. Many people became innocent victims of retribution, while others--among them notorious war criminals--escaped punishment. Nonetheless, the process of retribution was not useless but rather a historically unique effort to purify the continent of the many sins Europeans had committed. This book sheds light on the collective amnesia that overtook European governments and peoples regarding their own responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity--an amnesia that has only recently begun to dissipate as a result of often painful searching across the continent.</p><br><p> In inspiring essays, a group of internationally renowned scholars unravels the moral and political choices facing European governments in the war's aftermath: how to punish the guilty, how to decide who was guilty of what, how to convert often unspeakable and conflicted war experiences and memories into serviceable, even uplifting accounts of national history. In short, these scholars explore how the drama of the immediate past was (and was not) successfully "overcome." Through their comparative and transnational emphasis, they also illuminate the division between eastern and western Europe, locating its origins both in the war and in post-war domestic and international affairs. Here, as in their discussion of collaborators' trials, the authors lay bare the roots of the many unresolved and painful memories clouding present-day Europe.</p><br><p> Contributors are Brad Abrams, Martin Conway, Sarah Farmer, Luc Huyse, L�szl� Karsai, Mark Mazower, and Peter Romijn, as well as the editors. Taken separately, their essays are significant contributions to the contemporary history of several European countries. Taken together, they represent an original and pathbreaking account of a formative moment in the shaping of Europe at the dawn of a new millennium.</p></p><p><p>"This volume will contribute greatly to the reconfiguration of our understanding of Europe in the last fifty years and is of great help in stimulating an understanding of why it took so long for the democratic ideal to triumph over the whole of the continent."<b>--Antony Polonsky, Brandeis University</b></p><b>Istv�n De�k</b> is Seth Low Professor of History at Columbia University and the author of, among other books, <i>Beyond Nationalism: A Social and Political History of the Habsburg Officer Corps, l848-1918</i>. <b>Jan T.

Instead of teaching students to be critical thinkers and problem-solvers, we are asking them to memorize facts for multiple choice tests. This problem isn&#x2019;t limited to low-income school districts: even our top schools aren&#x2019;t teaching or testing the skills that matter most in the global knowledge economy. Our teens leave school equipped to work only in the kinds of jobs that are fast disappearing from the American economy. Meanwhile, young adults in India and China are competing with our students for the most sought-after careers around the world. Education expert Tony Wagner has conducted scores of interviews with business leaders and observed hundreds of classes in some of the nation&#x2019;s most highly regarded public schools.

Expansive, wide-ranging, and lavishly illustrated, this book studies achievements in all areas of the performing and fine arts, photography, literature, theatre, architecture, music, and film.</p><p>&#34;The Short Century&#34; includes the works of over 50 artists, from the paintings of Mancoba and Sekoto during the fifties, through the drawings and theatre projects of William Kentridge, up to the installations and video works of Kay Hassan and Oladele A.

The great writers of the continent - Soyinka, Senghor, and Cesaire amongst others - , Africa&#39;s filmmakers, architects, and musicians, all of whom left their mark on the process of decolonialization, are studied here in depth. Renowned historians and cultural philosophers discuss the background of developments and analyze the ideological strategies employed by Western colonial powers to preserve their grip on African countries and peoples. A chapter on photojournalism supplemented by a detailed chronology of events and political movements presents the main stages of Africa&#39;s political history.

Rex and the Crater of Doom</em>--a fascinating history.</strong></p> Walter Alvarez and his team made one of the most astonishing scientific discoveries of the twentieth century--that an asteroid smashed into the Earth 65 million years ago, exterminating the dinosaurs. Alvarez had the first glimmer of that amazing insight when he noticed something odd in a rock outcrop in central Italy. Alvarez now returns to that rich terrain, this time to take the reader on an distant past. We encounter the volcanoes that formed the Seven Hills of Rome; the majestic limestone Apennine mountains that started to develop millions of years ago <em>under water</em>; the evidence that the Mediterranean Sea completely evaporated to a sunken desert, perhaps several times; and the proof that continental plates once overran one another to form telling, all major geologic episodes are as dramatic as the great impact that killed the dinosaurs, even when they happen over eons and without huge creatures to witness them. 8 pages of color; 60 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Walter Alvarez, professor of geology at the University of California, Berkeley, received the Penrose Medal, the top honor in geology, and is the best-selling author of T.

The citizens cheer the&nbsp;conquering hero, but not all are pleased to see him return. Many fear that with nobody to oppose him, this military genius will become a cruel dictator. A conspiracy takes shape that ensnares the proud Brutus, one of Caesar's most trusted allies, in an assassination plot that will change the course of history.<br><br>What is most important, Shakespeare asks, loyalty to your leaders or to your country? Can good ever come of evil actions, and are those who speak of freedom always trustworthy?<br><br>Now imagined as a thrilling graphic adventure, William Shakespeare's classic retelling of actual historical events is revealed as a timeless political thriller - a bloody saga of friendships betrayed, alliances destroyed, and a nation torn apart by civil war.</p><p>Julius Caesar is a key link between Shakespeare&#39;s histories and his tragedies. Unlike the Caesar drawn by Plutarch in a source text, Shakespeare&#39;s Caesar is surprisingly modern: vulnerable and imperfect, a powerful man who does not always know himself. The open-ended structure of the play insists that revealing events will continue after the play ends, making the significance of the history we have just witnessed impossible to determine in the play itself. John D. Cox&#39;s introduction discusses issues of genre, characterization, and rhetoric, while also providing a detailed history of criticism of the play. Appendices provide excerpts from important related works by Lucretius, Plutarch, and Montaigne.Known as 'The Bard of Avon', William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, around April of 1564. His father, John Shakespeare, was a successful local businessman and his mother, Mary Arden, was the daughter of a wealthy landowner. In 1582, eighteen-year-old William married an older woman named Anne Hathaway. Soon they had their first daughter, Susanna, who was followed by twins Hamnet and Judith. Sadly, Hamnet died at the age of eleven.<br>Translated into innumerable languages across the globe, Shakespeare's plays and sonnets are undoubtedly the most studied works of literature in the English language. He was just as adept at writing comedies as he was tragedies, histories, and poetry. On top of this, he was also an actor. <br><br>Shakespeare died in 1616.</p><h2>International Organizational Behavior: Transcending Borders and Cultures</h2><p><p>In today&#x2019;s increasingly diverse, multicultural business world, managers and employees alike need to transcend many borders (literally or figuratively) and grasp a wide variety of cultural nuances on a routine basis.

Give me your date of birth, and I will show you your future. The hidden meaning and power of numbers has been studied since ancient times. Just as astrologers use the planets and signs of the zodiac to explore relationships and predict the future, so do numerologists use numbers. Now, by following numerologist Norman Shine&#39;s clearly illustrated, easy-to-understand system, anyone can access and use the energy and power of numbers. Each letter of the alphabet has numerical value, and each number is an energy source. It is the way that these energies combine and relate to one another that determines how and why you behave the way you do; by comparing your numbers with another person&#39;s, you can explore your relationship to them. Plot the numbers of your birthday, and you can see the direction of your future.</p><p>Norman Shine has been a consultant numerologist and astrologer more than 15 years, following a distinguished academic career.

The "devolution revolution" of the 1990s transferred many of the nation&#x2019;s principal domestic programs from federal to state management, often without transferring the necessary funding. This combination of expanded responsibilities and deficient resources has left many states in financial turmoil&#x2015;unable to fulfill policy promises.

His (Popper's) attack on Plato, while unorthodox, is in my opinion thoroughly justified. His analysis of Hegel is deadly. Marx is dissected with equal acumen, and given his due share of responsibility for modern misfortunes. The book is a vigorous and profound defence of democracy, timely, very interesting, and very well written'.<br>'A powerful and important book. It is a criticism of a set of dogmas which underlie the most influential political theories, and in consequence powerfully affect the actual conduct of human affairs. Dr Popper writes with extreme clarity and vigour. His studies in Greek history and Greek thought have obviously been profound and original. Platonic exegesis will never be the same again. Nor, I think, will Marxist exegesis.

Produced to accompany the first major exhibition ever organized on the Taoist philosophy and religion, this opulent book includes more than 150 works of art from as early as the late Zhou dynasty (fifth-third century b.c.) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Many of these works are paintings that show the breathtaking range of style and subject that makes the Taoist heritage so rich. Sculpture, calligraphy, rare books, textiles, and ritual objects are also represented.<br><br>Like the exhibition, the book is organized thematically. It begins with the sage Laozi (to whom the Daode Jing is attributed), and moves on to explore the birth of religious Taoism and the interaction between Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. A wealth of subjects are covered: the gods of the Taoist pantheon, ritual, the boundaries and intersections between Taoism and popular religion, Taoist Immortals and Realized Beings, the role of alchemy, sacred landscape and its significance, and Taoist temples and their architecture.<br><br><i>Taoism and the Arts of China</i> includes an engaging series of introductory essays by scholars with a deep understanding of their subjects. Among the topics discussed are a historical introduction to Taoism, archaeological evidence for early Taoist art, and a general introduction to the functions of art in religious Taoism. Lavishly illustrated with over 150 color images, this volume affords a sweeping view of an artistic terrain that until now has received too little exposure in the West. Its publication constitutes a major advance in Western understanding of this important tradition.</p><p>Mention Taoist art and people are most likely to think of tai chi. But a few centuries after the famous philosophers Laozi and Zhuangzi, the Taoist religion sprung up and brought with it a panoply of ink washes and images, immortals and iconography. In the year 2000, the Art Institute of Chicago mounted the first major exhibition of Taoist art and published a whopping catalog to go along with it. Full color photos, details, and two-page spreads splash across over 400 pages of catalog, featuring ornately embroidered silk priest robes, ritual swords inscribed with hexagrams from the Yi Jing, talismanic calligraphy, and rare money tree statues. Constellations and dragons, yin-yang symbols, and grotesque gods with Don King hair appear in paintings and relief, dating as far back as Charlemagne. And in case you're not up to speed on the history of Taoist religion and art, four experts chime in with extended essays, one of whom is even an ordained Taoist priest. So hang out with the seven worthies of the bamboo grove, watch Laozi ride an ox, or get lost in the clouds around an ethereal temple. <i>Taoism and the Arts of China</i> is a real find. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><b>Stephen Little</b>, Pritzker Curator of Asian Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, is an authority on Chinese and Japanese art.

Grote&#39;s method spread to other companies, and gained national recognition with the 1995 release of the first edition of Discipline Without Punishment. The book has become a management classic, helping thousands of companies and managers move to a responsibility-based approach for handling unacceptable performance, problem behaviors, and excessive absenteeism. But, despite the effectiveness of the DWP method, many supervisors and workplaces continue to cling to their long-established system of verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspensions without pay, and probationary periods-all fear-based approaches that instill lots of resentment, with little or no payback in improved performance. This new edition of the bestselling Discipline Without Punishment has been updated to help a new generation of managers and HR professionals adopt a positive, proven method for getting problem employees back on track. Packed with real-life examples, sample dialogues, helpful worksheets, and a no-nonsense sensibility that busy readers will sorely appreciate, the book remains an eye-opening, forward-looking, practical guide to making your disciplinary system equitable and effective.

As each boy is mistaken for the other, Tom enters a realm of privilege and pleasure beyond his most delirious dreams, while Edward plunges into a cruel, dangerous world of beggars and thieves, cutthroats and killers. Befriended by the heroic Miles Hendon, Edward struggles to survive on the squalid streets of London, in the process learning about the underside of life in &#x201c;Merry England.&#x201d;&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RWith its mixing of high adventure, raucous comedy, and scathing social criticism, presented in a hilarious faux-sixteenth-century vernacular that only Mark Twain could fashion, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Prince and the Pauper&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R remains one of this incomparable humorist&#x2019;s most popular and oft-dramatized tales.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RRobert Tine&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R is the author of six novels, including &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RState of Grace&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R and &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBlack Market&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R.

He has written for a variety of periodicals and magazines, from the <i>New York Times</i> to <i>Newsweek</i>. <br><br><b>From Robert Tine&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i></b> <p></p><p>The story itself&#x2014;the swapping of identities between Edward Tudor, heir to the throne of England, and one of his lowliest subjects, a certain Tom Canty of Offal Court, London&#x2014;was a neat conceit and one that no one would have doubted Twain would have immense fun spinning out. However, while there are moments in the book of what the critics called Twain&#x2019;s &#x201c;burlesque,&#x201d; this apparently simple story delves deeply into the baseness of the human condition&#x2014;and examines it closely at both ends of the social spectrum. It is not difficult to imagine wanton cruelty and pain meted out in the slums and low dens of Tudor London. But Twain did not spare the aristocracy; he accused them of cupidity, treachery, and outright violence. Brutality is no less brutal for having been dealt by a finely attired lord of the realm rather than by a drink-soaked mendicant clad in rags, worried that he will not come up with the two pennies required to pay his rent. One has to admit that to Twain&#x2019;s contemporaries, and to readers today, <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> is not a <i>funny</i> book.</p><p>But it is an exciting one, almost a thriller. Will the deception succeed? Will Tom Canty take the throne? And will Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales (as Twain erroneously styles him), live his life in rags and squalor, raving and raging until his dying day about his own blue blood and the common, ungrateful usurper of the throne? It&#x2019;s a close thing, and there are times when the reader doubts that Twain will manage to pull off a suitably happy ending.</p><p>Then there is the problem with the language Twain employs. The book is filled with archaic and, in the mouths of the noble characters, flowery language. The more base characters speak a guttural if elaborate patois: &#x201c;&#x2018;Gone stark mad as any Tom o&#x2019; Bedlam! . . . But mad or no mad, I and thy Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or I&#x2019;m no true man!&#x2019;&#x201d; (p. 24). The aristocrats are no less orotund, even when condemning one of their own to death: &#x201c;&#x2018;Alack, how I have longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it commeth, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. But speed ye, speed ye! let others do this happy office [that is, a beheading] sith &#x2019;tis denied to me&#x2019;&#x201d; (p. 52). This is not the Mark Twain the reading public was used to&#x2014;we are a long way from Tom, Huck, and Pudd&#x2019;nhead. But Twain had always been a meticulous and discerning student of the spoken word, and absent a living example of Tudor speech, he readily admitted reading a great deal of Shakespeare to get the language down for both prince and pauper.</p><p>At first, the language seems a trifle daunting, but it quickly becomes easy to read and in the end adds immeasurably to the authenticity of the book. To have had his characters speak in the manner of Victorian Londoners of his age would have undercut the profound sense of time and place Twain manages to convey so well.</p><p>Having said how much <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> is <i>not</i> a typical example of Twain&#x2019;s work, it is worth taking a look at the factors that make it, in fact, a comfortable fit with the rest of the Twain canon. Like Tom Canty, the pauper of the story, Twain knew well the privations of youthful poverty. His father, John Marshall Clemens </p><p>(1798&#x2013;1847), was an inept businessman, perennially in debt, sometimes bringing his family to such low financial water as to force the selling of family land, and even the household furniture. At one point in Twain&#x2019;s youth the family was forced to face the humiliation of having to take in boarders. True, Twain never knew the crushing poverty of the Canty clan, but he grew up knowing the cold sting of want.</p><p>Tom Canty&#x2019;s father is an ogre, a tyrant, a drunkard, and an abuser. Were he alive today his treatment of his family would, more than likely, land him in jail. Twain&#x2019;s own father, while no monster, was cold, distant, unaffectionate, and, it seems, uninterested in any of his seven children, still less in his wife (Jane Lampton Clemens, 1803&#x2013;1890), with whom he lived in a loveless marriage. As Twain admits so candidly in a fragment of an autobiography published in 1907: &#x201c;I had never once seen a member of the Clemens family kiss another one&#x2014;except once. When my father lay dying in our house in Hannibal he put his arm around my sister&#x2019;s neck and drew her down and kissed her, saying, &#x2018;Let me die.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Paine, A. B. <i>Mark Twain: A Biography</i>, Vol. I, New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1912, p. 73.) It is not difficult to imagine that Twain could take his own experiences of poverty and cruelty and amplify them into the truly ghastly conditions of Tom Canty&#x2019;s early life.</p><p>As Twain&#x2019;s reputation grew he was transformed from lowly newspaper reporter into celebrated author. This celebrity allowed him to hobnob with the Great and Good (including the Russian czar, the German kaiser, and the emperor of Austria-Hungary) and to develop a keen eye for the doings of the upper classes. The courts of the nineteenth century were at least as grand, perhaps even more so, than those of Tudor England. Mark Twain was a proud American and a republican, and he scoffed at the very notion of aristocracy, as well as at a type of American traveler of a certain class who fawned over the titled and highborn. However, he did admit: &#x201c;We are all like&#x2014;on the inside . . . we dearly like to be noticed by a duke. . . . When a returned American is playing the earls<b> </b>he has met I can look on silent and unexcited and never offer to call his hand, although I have three kings and a pair of emperors up my sleeve.&#x201d; (Camfield, p.376.) These crowned heads do more than just pump up an awestruck American Grand Tourist: Twain&#x2019;s travels in the courts, palaces, and lavish country houses of Europe must have provided grist for his mill and found their way into the pages of <i>The Prince and the Pauper.</i></p></p><h2>Value by Design: Developing Clinical Microsystems to Achieve Organizational Excellence</h2><p>Value by Design is a practical guide for real-world improvement in clinical microsystems.

Likewise, you will find that all joy and sorrow, all happiness and pain, depend on finding or not finding your own individual initiative.&#x201d; &nbsp;(Rudolf Steiner, Aug. 4, 1924)&nbsp;</p><p>Rudolf Steiner urges those who feel the calling of the Archangel Michael to become people of initiative. The anthroposophist should be aware that &#x201c;initiative lies in his karma, and much of what meets him in this life will depend on the extent to which he can become willingly, actively conscious of it.&#x201d; </p><p>In the second half of this inspiring lecture, Steiner describes how the being of Ahriman is able to work through the personal intellect of human beings today.<i>&nbsp;</i>As a consequence, we are called upon to be inwardly awake and vigilant at all times.</p></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

If left untreated, chronic insomnia reduces quality of life and increases risk for psychiatric and medical disease, especially depression and anxiety. There are two forms of insomnia: secondary insomnia, in which it is comorbid with another condition such as psychiatric disorders, chronic pain conditions, or cardiopulmonary disorders, and primary insomnia, which does not coexist with any other disorder. <br><br>This treatment program uses cognitive-behavioral therapy methods to correct poor sleep habits. CBT has been proven in multiple studies to improve sleep hygiene by reducing time spent in bed before sleep onset, reducing time spent awake after first sleep onset, and increasing the quality and efficiency of sleep. Developed by the authors, this evidence based treatment can be used for both primary and secondary insomnia sufferers. Patients are first given information about healthy sleep and the reasons for improving sleep habits, then a behavioral program is developed to address that patient's specific sleep problems. Use of sleep logs, assessment forms, and other homework (all provided in the corresponding workbook) allows client and therapist to work together to develop an effective sleep regimen tailored specifically for each client. Finally, several sessions are dedicated to increasing compliance and problem-solving.<br><br><strong>Treatments</strong><strong><em>ThatWork</em></strong><strong>TM represents the gold standard of behavioral healthcare interventions!</strong><br>� All programs have been rigorously tested in clinical trials and are backed by years of research<br>� A prestigious scientific advisory board, led by series Editor-In-Chief David H.

It explores the connections between the gold standard--the framework regulating international monetary affairs until 1931--and the Great Depression that broke out in 1929. Eichengreen shows how economic policies, in conjunction with the imbalances created by World War I, gave rise to the global crisis of the 1930s. He demonstrates that the gold standard fundamentally constrained the economic policies that were pursued and that it was largely responsible for creating the unstable economic environment on which those policies acted.

There were written down by Geoffrey Chaucer, and he called them <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>.<br> Geraldine McCaughrean retells <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> for children in a lively and humorous style which captures the original flair of Chaucer himself. She introduces us to the characters who told these tales: the shy, battle-hardened Knight, the Summoner whose breath smells of onions, the angry Miller with his read beard, and the Widow of Bath who likes a happy ending.<br> The stories and the characters are vividly brought to life by Victor Ambrus, with pictures of wild chases, exciting battles, and the April countryside through which the pilgrims travel.</p><p><br><strong>Geraldine McCaughrean</strong>, who lives in the UK, has also written <em>One Thousand and One Arabian Nights</em>, <em>El Cid</em>, and <em>Moby Dick</em>, all volumes in the Oxford Illustrated Classics series. <strong>Victor G.

The text provides balanced coverage of political, economic, cultural and social aspects of Indian history. While conveying the effects of European invasion on American Indian communities, the text gives greater attention to the impact of Native actions on the American environment. The authors&#39; Indian-centered point of view treats Indians as actors in their own right, existing in a larger society. As a result, some events in American history loom larger than they would in a general survey, while others, such as Reconstruction, receive minimal coverage. The People demonstrates that the active participation of American Indians in a modern, democratic society has shaped--and will continue to shape--national life.</p><p>R.

Far from fading away, anarchists dealt with major events such as the rise of Communism, the New Deal, atomic warfare, the black freedom struggle, and a succession of artistic avant-gardes stretching from 1915 to 1975.<br><br><i>Unruly Equality</i> traces U.S. anarchism as it evolved from the creed of poor immigrants militantly opposed to capitalism early in the twentieth century to one that today sees resurgent appeal among middle-class youth and foregrounds political activism around ecology, feminism, and opposition to cultural alienation.</p><p>&#x201c;Filled with unforgettable characters, plain heroism, impressive archival discoveries, and tough-minded judgments,&nbsp;<i>Unruly Equality</i> sharply challenges the view that the twentieth century saw anarchist activism and thought thoroughly eclipsed by the ascendancy of scientific socialism within social movements. Influential within campaigns for empowering immigrant workers, African Americans opposing Jim Crow, peacemakers, and the artistic imagination, the anarchists whose lives Cornell so dramatically recovers tested and reinvented their ideas in struggle.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Roediger, author of <i>Seizing Freedom: Slave Emancipation and Liberty for All</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Unruly Equality</i>&nbsp;is history for movement builders. In recovering the captivating story of twentieth-century U.S. anarchism,&nbsp;Cornell&nbsp;provides crucial insights into the development of direct democracy, non-hierarchy, prefiguration, and other concepts animating contemporary global movements. Highly readable and theoretically sharp, this book is a vital tool for world changers and scholars alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marina A. Sitrin, author of&nbsp;<i>Everyday Revolutions: Horizontalism and Autonomy in Argentina</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Unruly Equality</i> shows that a new version of anarchist politics emerged in the postwar decades that was critical of mainstream culture and intent on challenging authority and transforming everyday life; the radical politics of the &#x2019;60s, which at the time seemed to come out of nowhere, had roots in fact&nbsp;in the new anarchism of the previous decades. Cornell&#x2019;s scholarly&#x2014;and at the same time lively and engaging&#x2014;account of radical politics in a little-studied period gives us a deeper understanding of the development of radical politics in the latter half of the twentieth century. This book is crucial reading for anyone interested in that history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Barbara Epstein, author of&nbsp;<i>The Minsk Ghetto 1941</i>&#x2013;<i>1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism</i>Andrew Cornell is an educator and organizer who has taught at Williams College, Haverford College, and Universit� Stendhal-Grenoble 3.

Set in a village in the Beauce, in northern France, it depicts the harshness of the peasants' world and their visceral attachment to the land. Jean Macquart, a veteran of the battle of Solferino and now an itinerant farm labourer, is drawn into the affairs of the Fouan family when he starts courting young Fran�oise. He becomes involved in a bitter dispute over the property of Papa Fouan when the old man divides his land between his three children. Resentment turns to greed and violence in a Darwinian battle for supremacy.<br><br>Zola's unflinching depiction of the savagery of peasant life shocked his readers, and led to attacks on Naturalism's literary agenda. This new translation captures the novel's blend of brutality and lyricism in its evocation of the inexorable cycle of the natural world.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brian Nelson</strong> has been editor of the <em>Australian Journal of French Studies</em> since 2002. He is well known for his critical studies and translations of the novels of Emile Zola. These include <em>The Cambridge Companion to Zola, Zola and the Bourgeoisie</em>, and translations for Oxford World's Classics of <em>The</em> <em>Fortune of the Rougons, The Belly of Paris, The Kill, Pot Luck</em>, and <em>The Ladies' Paradise</em>. His most recent publication is <em>The Cambridge Introduction to French Literature</em> (CUP, 2015).<br><br><strong>Julie Rose</strong> is an internationally renowned translator, whose many translations range from Victor Hugo's <em>Les Mis'erables</em>, Racine's <em>Ph'edre</em> and Andr'e Gortz's <em>Letter to D</em> to a dozen works by celebrated urbanist-architect and theorist Paul Virilio, and other leading French thinkers.<br>Zola&#39;s novel is rich in insights like this. Its an outstanding example of Zola&#39;s storytelling in the service of a bigger picture, revealing the complexity of small village life without romanticising it or populating it with unrealistic quirky characters.

Explains the origin of phenomena commonly encountered in nature and art, emphasizing the physical aspects but also touching on aspects of physiology and psychology that directly influence how visual images are perceived. Covers the effect of mixing color, the notion of color spaces, how atoms and molecules affect light, how light can be measured, the effect of using a lens, and many other topics. Requires little or no mathematical background. Includes questions and references for further reading.</p><p>Light and Color R. Daniel Overheim and David L. Wagner, both of Edinboro State College This concise easy-to-teach textbook describes the physical nature of light, the analysis of color, the mechanisms of color vision, and the fundamentals of geometric and wave optics. Limited use of mathematics and physics combined with an easy, conversational writing style makes this book particularly appealing to students of art, photography, drama (stage lighting and design), television, architecture, interior and fashion design, and psychology. Students are carefully introduced to different kinds of light sources (continuum, bright-line), and the concepts, of reflection, transmission, absorption and additive and subtractive primary colors. Other chapters deal directly with color&#x2014;specifically colorimetry, color vision, the appearance of objects, and natural color phenomena. Extensively illustrated with color plates. Instructor&#x2019;s Manual available. 1982 269 pp. Principles of Color Technology, 2nd Edition Fred W. Billmeyer, Jr. and Max Saltzman This updated new edition describes all major developments applied to the use of colorants (dyes and pigments) in the industrial and creative production of colored materials. Basic theory remains the same but in many cases, practice has become considerably more automated. This second edition includes more extensive coverage of metamerism, non-color problems&#x2014;quality control, techniques of sampling and sample preparation, application of simple statistics, and methods for instrument selection. The authors also discuss some unsolved problems73151;for which technology has not fully developed. 1981 240 pp. Interested in color? You can&#x2019;t afford to be without a subscription to the one journal for all color specialists, for everyone involved in the application of color as well as research in the field. Editor-in-Chief: Fred W. Billmeyer, Jr. Color Research and Application Color Research and Application is the only English-language journal that covers the entire spectrum of color. It fills the void created by diverse publications which offer only minimal coverage of this broad subject. Each issue presents reports on the state of the art, original full-length articles, news notes, meeting announcements, and book reviews. This important publication is far more than a scientific and technological journal. It publishes articles on color in art, design, education, business and industry, and is concerned with the science, esthetics, psychology, engineering and technology of the field. Published quarterly. Subscription on calendar-year basis.This expansive, detailed treatment provides the color theory and optics background your students need to understand light and color phenomena in nature and art. Drawn from over 10 years of teaching experience, this innovative new text presents a broad range of topics allowing instructors the flexibility to pick and choose specific subjects. Among the many topics discussed are polarized light, lasers and the electro-optics of television sets (both color and black and white). Light and Color in Nature and Art is guaranteed to stimulate interest in students of diverse backgrounds. Practical applications to art, photography, holography, television, color printing, stage lighting, and atmospheric effects are highlighted with numerous examples and illustrations. The authors trace the evolution of modern color theory from Newton&#x2019;s crucial experiments through the origins of psychophysics in the 19th century to the establishment of an objective system of color measurement and specifications in the 20th century. Students are introduced to the elemental theory of ray optics and optical instruments, the operation of the eye, and the concepts underlying the production of light and its measurement. Then, a series of independent chapters carefully analyze the optics of a wide range of phenomena. Color plates help bring color phenomena to life for your students. And ... questions and annotated references at the end of each chapter make this extensively illustrated text an invaluable reference source.</p><h2>Anatomy of Malice: The Enigma of the Nazi War Criminals</h2><p><b>In this gripping and haunting narrative, a renowned psychiatrist sheds new light on the psychology of the war criminals at Nuremberg</b><br><br>When the ashes had settled after World War II and the Allies convened an international war crimes trial in Nuremberg, a psychiatrist, Douglas Kelley, and a psychologist, Gustave Gilbert, tried to fathom the psychology of the Nazi leaders, using extensive psychiatric interviews, IQ tests, and Rorschach inkblot tests. Never before or since has there been such a detailed study of governmental leaders who orchestrated mass killings.<br><br> Before the war crimes trial began, it was self-evident to most people that the Nazi leaders were demonic maniacs. But when the interviews and psychological tests were completed, the answer was no longer so clear. The findings were so disconcerting that portions of the data were hidden away for decades and the research became a topic for vituperative disputes. Gilbert thought that the war criminals&#x2019; malice stemmed from depraved psychopathology. Kelley viewed them as morally flawed, ordinary men who were creatures of their environment. Who was right?<br><br> Drawing on his decades of experience as a psychiatrist and the dramatic advances within psychiatry, psychology, and neuroscience since Nuremberg, Joel E. Dimsdale looks anew at the findings and examines in detail four of the war criminals, Robert Ley, Hermann G�ring, Julius Streicher, and Rudolf Hess. Using increasingly precise diagnostic tools, he discovers a remarkably broad spectrum of pathology.&nbsp;<i>Anatomy of Malice</i>&nbsp;takes us on a complex and troubling quest to make sense of the most extreme evil.</p><p>An eminent psychiatrist offers an eye-opening study of the psychology of evil based on the extensive psychological testing done on high-level Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg Trials.<br><b>Joel E. Dimsdale</b> is distinguished professor emeritus and research professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego.

It is the first comprehensive text in the growing field of critical urban studies to deal with the dramatically restructured megacities that have emerged world-wide over the last half of the twentieth-century.</p><p>A captivating guide to our urban future utilizing the urban geographic history of contemporary Los Angeles, a vivid &amp; far-reaching interpretation of the restructured megacity.<i>Postmetropolis</i> completes Edward Soja's trilogy aimed at expanding the scope and critical insight of our spatial imaginations. Applying the theoretical frameworks developed in <i>Postmodern Geographies</i> (1989) and <i>Thirdspace</i> (1996), it is the first comprehensive text in the growing field of critical urban and regional studies to deal with the dramatically restructured megacities that emerged worldwide over the last half of the twentieth century. At its core is a lively discussion of six discourses that have coalesced around explaining what Soja calls the postmetropolitan transition, a major sea change in how we live in cities and experience urbanism as a way of life. To provide depth to these discussions, the book begins with a rethinking of the debates on the origins of cities, the geohistorical evolution of urban form, and the dynamic relations between society and space in the specific context of urban agglomerations.<br> <p>In addition to being an innovative text in urban and regional studies and an insightful application of new approaches to interpreting the spatiality of human life, <i>Postmetropolis</i> is also a book about contemporary Los Angeles, a vivid and far-reaching interpretation of its turbulent recent history and geography. The book concludes with a look back to the civil unrest of 1992 to portray the postmetropolis in explosive crisis as well as to draw some hope for the future based on new coalition-based struggles for spatial justice and regional democracy.</p></p><h2>Panoramas Literarios Espana</h2><p>Developed for use in upper-level courses and written entirely in Spanish, this anthology introduces students to Peninsular literature.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the Global Music Series. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> <em>Music in Ireland</em> provides an engaging and focused introduction to Irish traditional music--types of singing, instrumental music, and dance that reflect the social values and political messages central to Irish identity. This music thrives today not only in Ireland but also in areas throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. <br> Vividly evoking Irish sounds, instruments, and dance steps, <em>Music in Ireland</em> provides a springboard for the discussion of cultural and historical issues of identity, community, nationalism, emigration, transmission, and gender. Using the informal instrumental and singing session as a focal point, Dorothea E. Hast and Stanley Scott take readers into contemporary performance environments and explore many facets of the tradition, from the "craic" (good-natured fun) to performance style, repertoire, and instrumentation. Incorporating first-person accounts of performances and interviews with performers and folklorists, the authors emphasize the significant roles that people play in music-making and illuminate national and international musical trends. They also address commercialism, globalization, and cross-cultural collaboration, issues that have become increasingly important as more Irish artists enter the global marketplace through recordings, tours, and large-scale productions like <em>Riverdance</em>. <br> Packaged with a 70-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed in the book, <em>Music in Ireland</em> features guided listening and hands-on activities that allow readers to gain experience in Irish culture by becoming active participants in the music.<br></p><p>Stanley Scott and Dora Hast are both at Southern Connecticut State University.

It presents material with a serious but easy-to-understand writing style that makes it accessible to readers without sacrificing important topics. The book emphasizes a finite state machine approach to CPU design, which provides a strong background for reader understanding. It forms a solid basis for readers to draw upon as they study this material and in later engineering and computer science practice. The book also examines the design of computer systems, including such topics as memory hierarchies, input/output processing, interrupts, and direct memory access, as well as advanced architectural aspects of parallel processing. <b> </b> To make the material accessible to beginners, the author has included two running examples of increasing complexity: the Very Simple CPU, which contains four instruction sets and shows very simple CPU design; and the Relatively Simple CPU which contains 16 instruction sets and adds enough complexity to illustrate more advanced concepts. Each chapter features a real-world machine on which the discussed organization and architecture concepts are implemented. <b> </b> This book is designed to teach computer organization/architecture to engineers and computer scientists. </p></p><p></p><h2>Progressive Sight Singing</h2><p>A comprehensive, student-centered, and flexible introduction to sight singing, <em>Progressive Sight Singing,</em> Second Edition, by Carol Krueger, presents students with the underlying grammar and syntax of musical structure and prepares them to perceive that structure with both the ear and the eye.

A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.&#34; So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author&#39;s lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, &#34;Moby-Dick&#34; is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.</p><p>Burt Reynolds reading this story brings expression, meaning and action to the chase of a lifetime.

Instead of starting with concepts and moving to application, this text starts with application, an introductory problem or challenge that encourages you to first empty out your ideas so you are ready to understand new ideas and acquire new skills. Each chapter provides a menu of resources for engagement, application, and learning, everything you need to develop the spot-on management skills you&#39;ll need to be a successful manager. This new learning philosophy leads you through a seven-step learning process: 1. Manager Challenge, 2. Initial Response, 3. Discover Yourself, 4. Discover Knowledge, 5. Action Learning Exercises, 6. Test Your Mettle, and 7. Personal Skills Log. Shorter, highly-focused chapters take you through each of these seven steps, allowing you to capture the essence and critical points for each topic. The mass of research material has been condensed and focused into discrete learning packages (chapters) designed specifically for engagement. BUILDING MANAGEMENT SKILLS offers a unique new set of Challenge Videos that are specifically designed to help develop your decision-making and thinking skills. After you watch the video challenge you are asked to respond to the challenge by solving the problem, helping you see the relevance of the chapter material and answering the question &#34;Why do I need to know this material?&#34;. These innovative, decision-making Challenge Videos are also available in CengageNOW. Organized around a new learning philosophy, with new technology and a coherent learning package for you to acquire management skills through an active &#34;first do, then learn&#34; approach, Daft and Marcic have created a truly unique learning experience with BUILDING MANAGEMENT SKILLS.</p><p>Richard L.

These two philosophies set the text apart from other offerings that just focus on providing information and then activities related to theory." "I would describe this text as an innovative approach to skills that covers all of the major areas that we are used to addressing. The difference is in the text's ability to "show" students areas of deficiency and thus motivate them to acquire, develop, and practice the relevant skills." "I'm excited about the idea of this text. If the authors effectively implement the do then learn as well as the less is more approach, coupled with fresh, innovative video scenarios, I would strongly consider this text for adoption."<br><br>"A novel way to organize/approach the material in a traditional skills/OB course."<br><br>"You need to place it [this book] on the market as the most innovative product in the world.

To its detractors, L. Ron Hubbard's space-age mysticism is a moneymaking scam and sinister brainwashing cult. But to its adherents, it is humanity's brightest hope. Few religious movements have been subject to public scrutiny like Scientology, yet much of what is written about the church is sensationalist and inaccurate. Here for the first time is the story of Scientology's protracted and turbulent journey to recognition as a religion in the postwar American landscape.</p><br><p> Hugh Urban tells the real story of Scientology from its cold war-era beginnings in the 1950s to its prominence today as the religion of Hollywood's celebrity elite. Urban paints a vivid portrait of Hubbard, the enigmatic founder who once commanded his own private fleet and an intelligence apparatus rivaling that of the U.S. government. One FBI agent described him as "a mental case," but to his followers he is the man who "solved the riddle of the human mind." Urban details Scientology's decades-long war with the IRS, which ended with the church winning tax-exempt status as a religion; the rancorous cult wars of the 1970s and 1980s; as well as the latest challenges confronting Scientology, from attacks by the Internet group Anonymous to the church's efforts to suppress the online dissemination of its esoteric teachings.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Church of Scientology</i> demonstrates how Scientology has reflected the broader anxieties and obsessions of postwar America, and raises profound questions about how religion is defined and who gets to define it.</p></p><p><p>"Hugh Urban has written an engaging book that tells the story of Scientology more thoroughly and in a more balanced way than any other treatment of the topic thus far. Were that not enough, this is also a book with much to say about the central question that has come to be debated among contemporary scholars of religion: What, after all, is this thing we call religion?"<b>--Robert Wuthnow, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Urban's compelling book provides a critical but balanced assessment of this very controversial new religion, highlighting the ways Hubbard and his church reflect the fear and suspicion, yet also the boundless national optimism, so characteristic of cold war America. This book will become the source for reliable information on Scientology."<b>--Lorne L. Dawson, University of Waterloo, author of <i>Comprehending Cults</i></b></p><p>"Until now there was no extensive scholarship on the Church of Scientology in existence. With the appearance of Urban's powerful and provocative new book, we are without question on radically new historical and theoretical ground with respect to the study of Scientology and, I dare say, new American religious movements in general. In every way, this is a major achievement."<b>--Jeffrey J. Kripal, Rice University, author of <i>Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal</i></b></p><b>Hugh B.

In formulating a modern answer to the question 'What is History?' Professor Carr shows that the 'facts' of history are simply those which historians have selected for scrutiny. Millions have crossed the Rubicon, but the historians tell us that only Caesar's crossing was significant. All historical facts come to us as a result of interpretative choices by historians influenced by the standards of their age. Yet if absolute objectivity is impossible, the role of the historian need in no way suffer; nor does history lose its fascination. This edition includes new material which presents the major conclusions of Professor Carr's notes for the second edition and a new preface by the author, in which he calls for &#x2018;a saner and more balanced outlook on the future'.</p><p>Edward Hallett Carr (1892-1982) was a historian, journalist, and international relations theorist.

Profiled in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Life</i>, and even <i>Penthouse</i> magazine, Finster is collected by galleries and museums worldwide, including the Smithsonian Institution.<p> He has appeared on <i>The Tonight Show</i>, created covers for the rock bands R.E.M. and the Talking Heads, and counts numerous celebrities among his friends. Now approaching 85 years old, Finster and his paintings of a peculiar heaven show no signs of slowing in popularity.</p><p> But no one has ever completely witnessed the early life and work of Howard Finster. No one has seen the Trion Garden, Finster's first environmental work of art. No one has seen the young man and young preacher with his family and his work in the Trion setting. No one except his family--until now.</p><p> With the publication of <i>Howard Finster: The Early Years</i>, the artist's daughter Thelma Finster Bradshaw has created a loving memoir and tribute to her father. As a valuable addition to America's folk archives, this family album of rare photos and early work presents a private portrait of the public man who leads the national folk art movement.</p></p><p>Thelma Finster Bradshaw is Howard Finster&#39;s daughter. She lives in Carrollton, Georgia.Now in his early eighties, Finster is one of the best-known "outsider" artists in the United States. His elaborate backyard structures of Paradise Garden near Summerville, GA, have attracted collectors and tourists since the 1970s, while many more are familiar with his cover art for R.E.M. and Talking Heads recordings. Yet these are just a minor part of his prolific output, and art is by no means his only career. Born into poverty in rural Alabama, Finster became a Baptist preacher at an early age, traveled to revivals, and built a church, a family, and an earlier version of Paradise Garden in Trion, GA. His second-youngest daughter, the author of this brief memoir, says, "To my father's way of thinking, his paintbrush is just a conduit for God, and my father just happens to be the medium." The family history is one of almost cheerful struggle, met with boundless energy, dedication, and resourcefulness. Bradshaw's simple, straightforward prose draws the reader into her enthusiastic portrayal of her father, but there is little to balance her heroic vision. Uplifting reading for general readers and aficionados of folk art.

This book concerns itself with the quantification of risk, the modelling of identified risks and how to make decisions from those models. Following on from the success of the previous edition of this clearly written and highly regarded book, this edition is extensively revised and updated and will provide an invaluable practical guide for beginners and experienced practitioners alike. Quantitative risk analysis (QRA) using Monte Carlo simulation offers a powerful and precise method for dealing with the uncertainty and variability of a problem. By providing the building blocks the author guides the reader through the necessary steps to produce an accurate risk analysis model and offers general and specific techniques to cope with most modelling problems. A wide range of solved problems is used to illustrate these techniques and how they can be used together to solve otherwise complex problems.

Developed in response to a severe void in the literature, the book addresses topics ranging from medicolegal investigation of death to death scene investigation, forensic autopsy, and artifacts of resuscitation as well as complications of medical therapy, forensic osteology, forensic odontology, forensic photography, and death certification. The book includes various types of cases, including sudden natural death, asphyxia, motor vehicle collisions, death in custody, child abuse and elder abuse, acute psychiatric and emotional deaths, and pregnancy. It contains sample descriptions of pathological lesions which serve to aid pathologists in reporting their findings to law enforcement agencies, attorneys, and others involved in investigations of sudden death. The concepts outlined in the text are beautifully illustrated by large, colorful photographs. There are also "Do and Don&#x2019;t" sections at the end of each chapter that provide guidance for handling the types of cases examined. This work will benefit not only experienced forensic pathologists, but also hospital pathologists who occasionally performs medicolegal autopsies; doctors in training; medical examiners; law enforcement personnel; crime scene investigators; attorneys; and fellows and students of the medical sciences.</p><ul><li>Large, colorful photographs which beautifully illustrate the concepts outlined in the text.</li><li>Sample descriptions of pathological lesions which serve to aid pathologists in reporting their findings to law enforcement agencies, attorneys, and others involved in investigations of sudden death.</li><li>'Do and Don't' sections at the end of each chapter which provide guidance for handling the types of cases examined within preceding sections.</li></ul></p><p>A simple, down-to-earth, photographic approach to the investigation of trauma and disease, containing over 1,800 full-color imagesDavid Dolinak is Chief Medical Examiner for Austin, TX.

Stephen Johnson has done a remarkable job of shining new light on this dark moment in U.S. submarine history."<br> --Sherry Sontag, coauthor of Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage<br> <br> "What happened to the USS Scorpion? The question has vexed submariners for almost four decades. Now, with meticulous research and incredible attention to detail, Stephen Johnson examines and dissects one of the most tragic and mysterious submarine accidents in U.S. Navy history."<br> --Douglas Waller, author of Big Red: Inside the Secret World of a Trident Nuclear Submarine<br> <br> "Stephen Johnson has crafted a forensic masterpiece that leads the reader back through time to unravel the gnawing enigma of the tragic 1968 loss of the nuclear attack submarine USS Scorpion. Sifting through a maze of conflicting theories, he meticulously lays out a tale of undersea detectives searching for conclusive evidence to one of the most baffling mysteries of the cruel sea."<br> --Rear Admiral Thomas Evans, author, analyst specializing in submarine history and operations, and former officer on the Scorpion<br> <br> "The manuscript arrived with yesterday's afternoon mail. I finished reading it by nightfall. It's that good! Thoroughly researched, impeccably documented, with an appealing and literate style, Silent Steel should become essential reading for submarine enthusiasts and for anyone else who enjoys an engaging and informative yarn."<br> --A. J. Hill, author of Under Pressure: The Final Voyage of Submarine S-Five</p><p>She lay quietly on the ocean floor two miles beneath the roiling surface of the Atlantic, her shattered and scattered corpse a mute testament to the perils of life aboard a submarine. But what had happened to the USS <i>Scorpion</i> and the ninety-nine men who perished with her on May 22, 1968? A Soviet attack? A torpedo malfunction? A faulty trash disposal unit? Amid these speculations, the U.S. Navy was sure of only one thing: the disaster was not caused "by the fault, negligence or inefficiency of any person or persons in the naval service." Stephen Johnson believes the full story is far less simplistic. <p>In <i>Silent Steel</i>, the veteran reporter who has been investigating the Scorpion disaster for nearly two decades provides the most comprehensive and authoritative analysis to date of this tragic and enduring mystery. Citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, letters home from sailors aboard the doomed vessel, and interviews with hundreds of eyewitnesses, military insiders, and submarine experts, Johnson recreates the <i>Scorpion</i>'s fatal cruise as well as the crucial events that preceded it. He clears away the confusion surrounding the loss of the <i>Scorpion</i> and puts a human face on the disaster, so often characterized as the loss of a complex machine rather than a catastrophe that took the lives of ninety-nine dedicated men.</p> <p>Most moving&#x2014;and most telling&#x2014;of Johnson's interviews is his conversation with Electrician's Mate Daniel Rogers, who served aboard the <i>Scorpion</i> until shortly before the boat was lost, knew virtually all of her crew, and remained deeply affected by the event until his own death in 2003. A demoralized Rogers warned of dangerous circumstances on the submarine he no longer trusted when he quit the boat six weeks before its final cruise. He would be haunted by the decision that saved his life.</p> <p>The aura of mystery surrounding what happened to the Scorpion has been abetted by the navy's unwillingness to divulge information about its own investigations. Now, many long-retired officers, sailors, and scientists feel that enough time has passed to allow them to speak openly about their roles as one-time <i>Scorpion</i> crewmembers or navy investigators. From these interviews and other newly available information, Johnson reveals a deep disagreement among investigators over what caused the disaster while piecing together a story that is both deeply troubling and bitterly ironic: the <i>Scorpion</i> fell victim to a plague of maintenance problems that dogged the U.S. Navy's submarine service during the 1960s. These maintenance problems were the unintended result of a program designed to make submarine operations safer after the 1963 loss of the USS Thresher, the first American nuclear-powered submarine disaster.</p> <p>Complete with vivid photos of the <i>Scorpion</i> and her crew, <i>Silent Steel</i> combines a thrilling adventure story and an intriguing mystery with a cautionary tale about the limits of technology and the high price of failure at sea.</p>Veteran journalist <b>STEPHEN JOHNSON</b> first wrote about the <i>Scorpion</i> in a series of articles for the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> from 1993 to 1995 and assisted documentary makers and authors researching the disaster, including the authors of the bestselling <i>Blind Man's Bluff</i>. Johnson has discussed the <i>Scorpion</i> on Nova's Submarines, Secrets, and Spies and on The History Channel.</p><h2>Social Work ASWB Masters Exam Guide: A Comprehensive Study Guide for Success</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Dawn gave us the tools we needed to take the exam, and let me tell you&#x2014;she was on point!

Starting with pieces that draw entirely on the writer's life to biography requiring research into another person's life, the reader moves from subjective to objective experience and finally to the essay that attempts to put that experience into a larger context. The selections are followed by "Musings" which suggest features of the writing that the reader might imitate and recommendations for writing. "Connections" presents ways in which individual pieces might be paired with others to make interesting comparisons and to generate other writing ideas. <b> </b> A range of familiar and unfamiliar selections are organized from the subjective to the objective and become increasingly difficult. They present a wide range of writing styles to allow readers to become comfortable with many styles. In addition, these selections represent a variety of cultures and historical periods to give readers an appreciation of other cultures and a sense of history. <b> </b> A valuable book for any reader who wishes to improve their writing skills by reading a variety of selections by a range of writers. </p></p><p>This reader focuses exclusively on reading and writing about the self and others. It offers selections that move from writing for oneself (journals and diaries) to writing for an audience (letters); from writing based on personal experience (autobiographies) to writing based on research (biographies). This development culminates in the essay, a form of writing in which personal experience and gained knowledge are shared with a public readership. Selections are followed by &#34;Musings,&#34; which point out rhetorical and thematic features of the writing that students can analyze. Many contain writing suggestions asking students to imitate a writer&#39;s style or strategy. &#34;Making connections,&#34; a short section appearing at the front of the text, is designed to generate ideas for class discussion and writing assignments by showing students how to compare selections written by the same author or written about the same subject.Life writing involves an in-depth investigation into the nature of self and others that grows out of self-awareness and identification with others. As writers, we must always begin with what we know best-- our own experience of the world--and attempt through words to make that experience meaningful for others.</p><h2>The Favershams</h2><p>Relates in rhyme the life of an English Army major, born in 1851, and his wife.</p><p></p><h2>The Unbanking of America: How the New Middle Class Survives</h2><p><b>An urgent, absorbing expos�&#x2014;why Americans are fleeing&nbsp;our broken banking system in growing numbers, and how alternatives are rushing in to do what banks once did</b><br><br> What do an undocumented immigrant in the South Bronx, a high-net-worth entrepreneur, and a twenty-something graduate student have in common?&nbsp;All three are victims of our dysfunctional mainstream bank and credit system.&nbsp;Today nearly half of all Americans live from paycheck to paycheck, and income volatility&nbsp;has doubled over the past thirty years.&nbsp;Banks, with their high monthly fees and overdraft charges, are gouging their low- and middle-income customers, while serving only the wealthiest Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>Lisa Servon delivers a stunning indictment of America&#x2019;s banks, together with eye-opening dispatches from inside a range of banking alternatives that have sprung up to fill the void.

Drawing on his personal experiences raising pigs as well as his sharp investigative instincts, Estabrook covers the range of the human-porcine experience. He embarks on nocturnal feral pig hunts in Texas. He visits farmers who raise animals in vast confinement barns for Smithfield and Tyson, two of the country&#x2019;s biggest pork producers. And he describes the threat of infectious disease and the possible contamination of our food supply. Through these stories shines Estabrook&#x2019;s abiding love for these remarkable creatures. Pigs are social, self-aware, and playful, not to mention smart enough to master the typical house dog commands of &#x201c;sit, stay, come&#x201d; twice as fast as your average pooch. With the cognitive abilities of at least three-year-olds, they can even learn to operate a modified computer. Unfortunately for the pigs, they&#x2019;re also delicious to eat.</p><p>Estabrook shows how these creatures are all too often subjected to lives of suffering in confinement and squalor, sustained on a drug-laced diet just long enough to reach slaughter weight, then killed on mechanized disassembly lines. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. <em>Pig Tales</em> presents a lively portrait of those farmers who are taking an alternative approach, like one Danish producer that has a far more eco-friendly and humane system of pork production, and new, small family farms with free-range heritage pigs raised on antibiotic-free diets. It is possible to raise pigs responsibly and respectfully in a way that is good for producers, consumers, and some of the top chefs in America.</p><p>Provocative, witty, and deeply informed, <em>Pig Tales</em> is bound to spark conversation at dinner tables across America.</p></p><p>A three-time James Beard Award winner, Barry Estabrook is a former contributing editor at Gourmet magazine and the author of Pig Tales and Tomatoland.

He maintains the fine air of detachment at the beginning of each tale. Then, as each tale unfolds, he draws us in as Poe intended, making the full effect unsettling and in several cases chilling. Sachs speaks clearly and chooses few characterizations in the stories. There are numerous more dramatized readings of Poe&#39;s stories, but Sachs&#39;s straight-forward, intelligent presentation is an excellent choice for listeners who want unadorned narrative. R.F.W.

Marc Chagall&#x2019;s work addresses these transforming events, but his ambivalence about his role as a Jewish artist adds an intriguing wrinkle to common assumptions about his life. Drawn to sacred subject matter, Chagall remains defiantly secular in outlook; determined to &#x201c;narrate&#x201d; the miraculous and tragic events of the Jewish past, he frequently chooses Jesus as a symbol of martyrdom and sacrifice.<br><br>Wilson brilliantly demonstrates how Marc Chagall&#x2019;s life constitutes a grand canvas on which much of twentieth-century Jewish history is vividly portrayed. Chagall left Belorussia for Paris in 1910, at the dawn of modernism, looking back dreamily on the world he abandoned. After his marriage to Bella Rosenfeld in 1915, he moved to Petrograd, but eventually returned to Paris after a stint as a Soviet commissar for art. Fleeing Paris steps ahead of the Nazis, Chagall arrived in New York in 1941. Drawn to Israel, but not enough to live there, Chagall grappled endlessly with both a nostalgic attachment to a vanished past and the magnetic pull of an uninhibited secular present. <br><br>Wilson&#x2019;s portrait of Chagall is altogether more historical, more political, and edgier than conventional wisdom would have us believe&#x2013;showing us how Chagall is the emblematic Jewish artist of the twentieth century.<br><br>Visit nextbook.org/chagall for a virtual museum of Chagall images.</p><p>Jonathan Wilson is the author of <i>A Palestine Affair, The Hiding Room, Schoom, </i>and<i> An Ambulance Is on the Way: Stories of Men in Trouble</i>; and of two critical studies of the fiction of Saul Bellow. His work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, </i>and<i> Best American Short Stories</i>, among other publications. A professor of English at Tufts University, he lives with his family in Newton, Massachusetts.<b>Chapter One: Vitebsk </b><br><br>Marc Chagall was born Moishe (Movcha) Shagal in the run-down Pestkovatik neighborhood of the Belorussian town of Vitebsk (population 65,000) on July 6 (not July 7 as he claimed&#x2014;he preferred the number 7) in 1887. He was born dead and brought to life by someone who speedily dipped him in a pail filled with cool water. Not far away a fire raced through the town, destroying 125 shops, 268 wooden houses, and 16 other buildings. Fire and water: a sturdy elemental beginning for a painter. <br><br>If baby Shagal&#x2019;s startled eyes had been able to take in his surroundings, or if his body had been able to levitate with the ease of the figures in his adult paintings, he would have seen close to his birthplace the walls of both the town&#x2019;s local prison and its lunatic asylum. Already in place too, as if waiting for him, were the neighborhood rooftops on Pokrowskaya Street, the animals in the street, the onion-domed churches, Torah-clutching rabbis, women with baskets, men burdened with the yoke not of the Torah but of milk-filled buckets, and perhaps even someone playing a fiddle and leading a wedding procession. <br><br>The characters, creatures, and buildings to be found on the outskirts of Vitebsk, where most of its Jewish population lived, and that were to become Chagall&#x2019;s obsessive lifelong subject, were not, however, the whole story of the town. For Chagall frequently chose to collapse broad Vitebsk where it sat on the confluence of the Vitba and Dvina rivers into a narrow frame and reconstruct it in his memory as a landlocked shtetl, a small Jewish village more like Lyosno, some thirty miles away, where his maternal grandparents lived. <br><br>The Vitebsk that Chagall&#x2019;s paintings gave the world has been accepted as a representation of a lost Jewish world that can be happily regarded with nostalgia. And indeed it is. But a visitor in 1887 alighting in Vitebsk from a train en route from Odessa or Kiev to St. Petersburg, or from Riga on the way to Moscow, would have searched long and hard for a fiddler on the roof. Instead, he or she would have seen the impressive Uspensky Cathedral, or the new railway bridge, and, if in search of music, might have headed for one of the city&#x2019;s other imposing buildings that functioned as temporary homes for the visiting theater companies or famous musicians who gave concerts there. <br><br>Sometimes these local Vitebsk landmarks appear in Chagall&#x2019;s art (as in <i>Double Portrait with Wineglass</i>, 1917&#x2013;18), but they are not its important symbolic sites. Throughout his painting career Chagall insistently brought the world of big history to the little streets of his old neighborhood as he knew it in early childhood: the Holocaust takes place on the streets where Chagall grew up, and Jesus, frequently wearing a tallith (prayer shawl) around his waist, is repeatedly crucified there. If he is not bringing history to Vitebsk then Chagall is carrying Vitebsk with him, as in a suitcase of the mind, wherever he goes. He has only to unpack his imagination, peer out of his window in Paris, and there are Pestkovatik&#x2019;s tiny houses, shops, and <i>stiebls</i> (small, one-room synagogues) lining up sideways under the Eiffel Tower. <br><br>Much of what we know of Chagall&#x2019;s early life is to be discovered in his memoir <i>My Life</i>, written when Chagall was only thirty-five during a tumultuous year that he spent in Moscow from 1921 to 1922. Like Chagall&#x2019;s paintings, however (and the text is accompanied by a number of Chagall&#x2019;s etchings and drypoints), his writing tends toward the ahistorical, and proceeds via anecdote and association. There are no dates to set parameters for the reader; instead there are charged descriptions of individuals, rhetorical flourishes, lyric passages, sentimentalized recollections, and a considerable amount of self-aggrandizement. The latter is quite understandable for an artist with a singular and established reputation who had, at his time of writing, been packed off by the local Soviet Narkompross (People&#x2019;s Commissariat of Enlightenment) to teach drawing to two colonies of war orphans in Malakhovka on the outskirts of Moscow. But I am getting ahead of the story. <br><br>&#x201c;My father&#x2019;s clothes shone with herring brine,&#x201d; Chagall writes in <i>My Life</i>; &#x201c;he lifted heavy barrels and my heart used to twist like a Turkish bagel as I watched him lift those weights and stir the herrings with his frozen hands.&#x201d; Poor laborers in the herring business worldwide, even those without a heartfelt attachment to the circumscribed rubrics of Hasidic Jewish life, have rarely shown great enthusiasm for the life of high art. Sachar Shagal was no exception. This father of eight had other aspirations for his eldest son along the familiar &#x201c;paying job&#x201d; lines. However, when the crunch came and Chagall needed money to enroll in a St. Petersburg art school, Sachar reached deep into his pockets, produced the necessary rubles, and mischievously rolled them under the kitchen table for his son to scramble after. In his memoir Chagall recalls this moment of combined joy and humiliation with a wave of the hand: &#x201c;I forgive him it was his way of giving.&#x201d; <br><br>As if to confirm this exculpation, Chagall&#x2019;s 1914 portrait <i>My Father</i> is decidedly empathetic. This watercolor on paper, which presently hangs in St. Petersburg&#x2019;s Russian Museum, presents a stoop-shouldered figure with trouble in his eyes. He sits in his kitchen, a glass of tea and lumps of sugar on the table before him, a cat and an old babushka to his left. The herring brine shine is not visible on his royal blue jacket or matching cap. In his outfit he resembles Van Gogh&#x2019;s postman. In the top right-hand corner we can clearly see the bolt on the door. Behind his left shoulder, through a window, sheets are hung out to dry. Chagall&#x2019;s father was fifty-one and his son twenty-seven when this painting was accomplished. Chagall had already been to Paris, achieved some fame if not fortune, and returned. The father is in a reduced place, and the sense of a life sacrificed to hard labor is palpable. He is similarly downcast in the 1911 pen-and-ink sketch <i>My Father, My Mother and Myself</i>, where, by contrast, Chagall&#x2019;s mother wears a superb hat and a cheerful smile. <br><br>As an accompaniment to his memoir (or perhaps it is really the other way round) numerous paintings and drawings completed by Chagall in his early twenties also tell the story of his childhood in Vitebsk, including <i>Sabbath</i> (1910), <i>Our Dining Room</i> (1911), <i>Village with Water Carriers</i> (1911&#x2013;12), and <i>The Village Store</i> (1911). But perhaps none of them unlock the past with such a ripple effect as <i>The Dead Man</i> (1908). Chagall executed this important painting when he was a twenty-one-year-old student in Leon Bakst&#x2019;s class at the Zvantseva Academy in St. Petersburg. <br><br>The specific inspiration for <i>The Dead Man</i> is a memory of childhood that Chagall records in <i>My Life</i>. &#x201c;Suddenly . . .&nbsp; well before dawn . . . a woman, alone, running through deserted streets.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s husband is dying and she implores the neighbors, who include young Chagall, to save him. &#x201c;The light from the yellow candles, the color of that face, barely dead . . . The dead man . . . is already laid out on the floor, his face illumined by six candles.&#x201d; <br><br>From a biographical rather than a pictorial point of view, what intrigues in this painting are its departures from Chagall&#x2019;s inspirational memory. In <i>The Dead Man</i> &#x201c;deserted streets&#x201d; are no longer deserted. Instead we see, in addition to the screaming woman, not only the body laid out but also a preoccupied street sweeper (grim reaper?) plying his predawn trade. Most significantly, Chagall has moved the action that in life he witnessed indoors to the outdoors, and the corpse, displaced into the street but still surrounded by six burning candles, now strikes a decidedly un-Jewish pose. <br><br>If artists have one big job, it is to move what is inside to the outside, to reveal secrets, and in so doing to allow us to discover who we are. At the beginning of his career, Chagall crossed a number of necessary boundaries with <i>The Dead Man</i>, which is at once an attempted farewell to Vitebsk and a lamentation; a recording and transgression of the Jewish world he knew so well. Moreover, the striking disproportions in the painting, in which figures are larger than houses, points as much to the disproportionate weight of childhood on Chagall&#x2019;s imagination (a mismatch that, as for most of us, was to be lifelong) as it does to the influence of the neoprimitivist style in vogue at the time. <br><br>Like so many great artists, Chagall retained a persistent obsession with the place that he needed to leave behind in order to create his art, and there is little difference in this regard between Chagall&#x2019;s relation to Vitebsk and that of James Joyce to Dublin or Philip Roth to Newark. <br><br>In <i>The Dead Man</i> we also find the inevitable fiddler on the roof, and a word about that emblematic Chagallian figure is appropriate here. The first rooftop violinist in Chagall&#x2019;s oeuvre is not the least bit contrived. He&#x2019;s simply a guy in a hat (no beard) on a roof playing what one assumes is mournful music. Or perhaps, like the street sweeper, he is indifferent to the dead man and the grieving woman below him. A large boot indicating a cobbler&#x2019;s shop hangs from the eaves of his roof (Chagall has written that his Uncle Neuch &#x201c;played the violin like a cobbler&#x201d;), but the fiddler&#x2019;s location is not magically realistic. It was not at all uncommon for shtetl and town residents alike to take to their rooftops, sometimes out of fear and sometimes for fun. Chagall&#x2019;s grandfather, for example, liked to climb up on high to chew a few carrots and watch the world go by. <br><br>But without doubt the fiddler is an important figure for Chagall: that local musician in Vitebsk&#x2019;s poorest neighborhood was probably Chagall&#x2019;s first apprehension of a performing artist; a creative individual who has both distance from the emotions that he excites and a commitment to technique. The fiddler is also a gypsy wanderer, a musical peddler whose art eases his passage between disparate worlds. There is a great seduction in vagabond heels. <br><br>If the fiddler was a part of Chagall&#x2019;s sentimental education, so too was his local synagogue. On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Chagall&#x2019;s father wrote an instructional &#x201c;Weep&#x201d; in his wife&#x2019;s prayer book next to certain passages. Feiga-Ita, like the other wives in the assembly, followed orders: &#x201c;When coming to the sign &#x2018;Weep,&#x2019; &#x201d; Chagall writes, his mother &#x201c;would begin . . . to shed divine tears. Their [the women&#x2019;s] faces would redden and little moist diamonds would trickle down, drop by drop, sliding over the pages.&#x201d; This anecdote tells us something about Chagall&#x2019;s early introduction to the mechanics of sentimentality, but it might also be read as a useful allegory of Chagall&#x2019;s relationship with his audience when he is not at the top of his game: an appeal for a ritualized lachrymose response to work that carries the memory of suffering or joy without necessarily representing it fully. <br><br>But perhaps it is better here to focus on Feiga-Ita herself. For when it came to her son&#x2019;s career, this loving and lovable daughter of a kosher butcher in nearby Lyosno, who ran a small grocery store by day and her Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe household in her off-hours, was not always so dutiful. In the face of her husband&#x2019;s early opposition, she encouraged Chagall to indulge his talent even while she remained baffled by it. And when, probably at around the age of thirteen, Chagall implored her, &#x201c;Mama . . . I want to be a painter,&#x201d; she brought him, against her own better instincts (she thought clerking might be a good profession), to the local art school run by Yehuda Pen. It was there at &#x201c;Artist Penne&#x2019;s School of Painting and Design&#x201d; that Chagall took his first significant steps toward mastery. <br><br>Yehuda Pen had sectioned off one room in his central Vitebsk apartment and opened his School of Drawing and Painting in November 1897. Like Chagall he had grown up in a large and struggling Jewish family. His gift for drawing had become apparent in cheder (Hebrew school) as he decorated Purim rattles and the title pages of books. As he grew older he became known in his local town of Novo-Alexandrov for his sketches of local inhabitants, including mounted Cossacks. Pen&#x2019;s mother (his father had died when he was four) disapproved of his calling; unlike Feiga-Ita Shagal, she was indifferent to her son&#x2019;s talent, so she left him to make his own way in the world. The obvious stopgap direction for Pen when he needed money was house or sign painting&#x2014; the latter a job that would also be Chagall&#x2019;s for a while. Indeed, the trajectory of Pen&#x2019;s early career matches that of Chagall in numerous ways, but precedes it by some twenty-five years. <br><br>Until the 1917 Revolution Jews did not have the &#x201c;right of residence&#x201d; in St. Petersburg but were confined to their Pale of Settlement. This presented a significant problem if you wanted to achieve any kind of higher education. As Chagall was to do later with dire consequences, Pen lived illegally in St. Petersburg (he bribed his &#x201c;yardkeeper&#x201d;) and managed to enroll in the Academy of Arts. A stellar student, Pen graduated in 1885 with the prestigious Silver Medal. He was then lucky enough to find a patron in Baron N. N. Korf, who invited him to work on his estate outside Kreizburg, not far from Vitebsk. Pen stayed five years, and shortly after a brief unsuccessful return to St. Petersburg he was lured to Vitebsk by members of the town&#x2019;s local Jewish intelligentsia, who both encouraged him and lent him the financial support necessary to open his art school. The young man who was to become his most famous student showed up nine years later. <br><br>Like Chagall, Pen emerged from a Hasidic milieu, and a great deal of his work records its figures and structures. While he sometimes worked from photographs, Pen preferred to use models and to draw or paint from life. For the most part his oil paintings are technically sound and essentially conservative naturalistic genre portraits: <i>Portrait of a Jew in a Black Cap</i> (ca. 1900), <i>An Old Woman with a Book</i> (Chumash) (ca. 1900), and <i>Letter from America</i> (<i>The Artist&#x2019;s Mother</i>) (1903) hold no surprises. Nonetheless, his influence on Chagall, even as a force to be challenged rather than emulated, should not be underestimated. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes, he has some ability,&#x201d; were Pen&#x2019;s first words to Chagall&#x2019;s mother, after he had glanced through Chagall&#x2019;s &#x201c;portfolio,&#x201d; which consisted of works copied from the magazine <i>Niwa</i>. Chagall&#x2019;s unspoken response, as he remembers it, was combative. &#x201c;I feel instinctively that this artist&#x2019;s method is not mine. I don&#x2019;t know what mine is. I haven&#x2019;t time to think about it.&#x201d; Chagall&#x2019;s &#x201c;method,&#x201d; as it eventually emerged, revealed a quite different absorption and internalization of the Hasidic world familiar to both pupil and teacher. Pen, schooled in a rigorous late-nineteenth-century academy, approached his subject matter no differently from any number of painters addressing their outside worlds. The inner life of the Jews that Pen chose to represent, albeit a brave choice of subject (at the St. Petersburg Academy Jewish students were generally treated with suspicion and hostility, and they tended to keep to themselves), affected his method hardly at all. A Hasid pictured bathing a horse in <i>Bathing Horse</i> (1910) is, more or less, what it says it is.</p><h2>Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems</h2><p>The world has changed radically since the first edition of this book was published in 2001.

Hendrix, DVM, PhD, Associate Professor of Parasitology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, ALThe addition of colour photos and tables throughout make for a much lighter read - the information is well presented. Procedure boxes are present throughout the text, and this makes the book a useful quick-reference guide to performing less familiar laboratory procedures in a clinical situation. The text also offers a detailed analysis of the chemistry and physiology behind the tests or procedures performed, which gives the reader a greater understanding of how results are generated. This is a huge advantage when interpreting results, particularly when unexpected results are obtained. This book would be a most welcome addition to the practice shelves. Although it may well be stationed in the practice laboratory, this does not do the text justice. It manages to bridge the gap between clinical veterinary medicine and laboratory medicine and, therefore, can provide useful information, from diagnostic sampling to the veterinary interpretation of results obtained.

Although the word suggests companionship and commitment, it&#x2019;s weighted with the knowledge that marriage is a male-dominated institution in which women have been subservient for centuries. In this provocative collection of essays, writers in their twenties and thirties discuss how they&#x2019;re navigating the waters of sanctified long-term relationships. Juhu Thukral speaks of marrying to please her traditional Indian parents; Rachel Fudge wonders whether alternative ceremonies can lead to greater equality in marriage; Kate Epstein tries to balance motherhood with a career; Kristy Harcourt, a lesbian, discusses her ambivalence about marriage ceremonies; and Leslie Miller struggles with being identified as half of a couple.</p><p>Organized by Corral, a freelance editor, and Miya-Jervis, editor and publisher of Bitch magazine, this anthology by Generation X women is both fascinating and provocative. It's also just an all-around good read, as the 30 pieces are uniformly well written, a welcome change from most anthologies. Straight and queer authors give intimate looks at their love lives, particularly their present (or just-past) long-term relationships. Topics range from how one woman ended up in a nine-year trilateral relationship that resulted in children to how an author is balancing her needs for privacy and intimacy. Topics in between include how to deal with lesbian weddings, straight weddings, balancing partners' ethnicity, having children, naming children, not having children, not getting married at all, and being a lesbian married to a gay man. A foreword by bell hooks rounds out this work, another entry in Seal Press's excellent "Live Girls" series, which focuses on marriage and intimacy from the perspectives of twenty- and thirtysomething women.

Traveling from culturally liberal, self-consciously &#x201c;green&#x201d; Vancouver, and aware that our well-meaning performances of recycling and climate-justice marching are accompanied by constant driving, flying, heating, and fossil-fuel consumption, Hern and Johal want to talk to people whose lives and fortunes depend on or are imperiled by extraction. They are seeking new definitions of ecology built on a renovated politics of land. Traveling with them is their friend Joe Sacco&#x2015;infamous journalist and cartoonist, teller of complex stories from Gaza to Paris&#x2015;who contributes illustrations and insights and a chapter-length comic about the contradictions of life in an oil town. The epic scale of the ecological horror is captured through an series of stunning color photos by award-winning aerial photographer Louis Helbig.</p><p>Seamlessly combining travelogue, sophisticated political analysis, and ecological theory, speaking both to local residents and to leading scholars, the authors propose a new understanding of ecology that links the domination of the other-than-human world to the domination of humans by humans. They argue that any definition of ecology has to start with decolonization&nbsp;and that confronting global warming requires a politics that speaks to a different way of being in the world&#x2015;a reconstituted understanding of the sweetness of life.</p><p>Published with the help of funding from Furthermore: a program of the J.

Some say he's a sage. He was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But this man, Siddhartha, was not a follower of any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence, and charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a life of pleasure and titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other "child people," dragged around by his desires. Like Hermann Hesse's other creations of struggling young men, <i>Siddhartha</i> has a good dose of European angst and stubborn individualism. His final epiphany challenges both the Buddhist and the Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river. In this translation Sherab Chodzin Kohn captures the slow, spare lyricism of Siddhartha's search, putting her version on par with Hilda Rosner's standard edition. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam.

Indeed, the belief that more guns in private hands means higher rates of armed crime underlies most modern gun control legislation. But are these assumptions valid? </p><p> Investigating the complex and controversial issue of the real relationship between guns and violence, Joyce Lee Malcolm presents an incisive, thoroughly researched historical study of England, whose strict gun laws and low rates of violent crime are often cited as proof that gun control works. To place the private ownership of guns in context, Malcolm offers a wide-ranging examination of English society from the Middle Ages to the late twentieth century, analyzing changing attitudes toward crime and punishment, the impact of war, economic shifts, and contrasting legal codes on violence. She looks at the level of armed crime in England before its modern restrictive gun legislation, the limitations that gun laws have imposed, and whether those measures have succeeded in reducing the rate of armed crime. </p><p> Malcolm also offers a revealing comparison of the experience in England experience with that in the modern United States. Today Americans own some 200 million guns and have seen eight consecutive years of declining violence, while the English--prohibited from carrying weapons and limited in their right to self-defense have suffered a dramatic increase in rates of violent crime. </p><p> This timely and thought-provoking book takes a crucial step in illuminating the actual relationship between guns and violence in modern society. </p></p><p><b>Joyce Lee Malcolm</b> is Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/MALGUN_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>The Letters of Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov</h2><p><p>This volume presents the complete correspondence between two of the most important and influential American poets of the postwar period. The almost 500 letters range widely over the poetry scene and the issues that made the period so lively and productive. But what gives the exchange its special personal and literary resonance is the sense of spiritual affinity and shared conviction about the power of the visionary imagination. Duncan and Levertov explore these matters in rich detail until, under the stress of dealing with the Vietnam War in poetry, they discover deep-seated differences in the religious and ethical convictions underlying their politics and poetic stance. The issues that drew them together and those that drove them apart create a powerful personal drama with far-reaching historical and cultural significance.

It tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky, and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who competes with Abraham &#34;Brom Bones&#34; Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and sole child of a wealthy farmer. As Crane leaves a party, he is pursued by the Headless Horseman, who is supposedly the ghost of a Hessian trooper who had his head shot off by a stray cannonball during &#34;some nameless battle&#34; of the American Revolutionary War, and who &#34;rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head.&#34;</p><p>Alice Hoffman is the author of fourteen novels, including <b>Practical Magic</b>, <b>Turtle Moon</b>, <b>Local Girls</b>, <b>Here on Earth</b>, <b>The River King</b>, and <b>Blue Diary</b>. She lives in Massachusetts.Abridged but not rewritten, the classic tale is decorated with a plethora of very small, comically gothic cartoons that add an air of spooky grotesquerie. An overall color scheme of pale browns and oranges adds a properly autumnal air to Sleepy Hollow&#39;s knobby woodlands, and the supporting cast includes nearly as many ghosts, toothy imps and the like as it does human figures. Grimly&#39;s not much for verisimilitude - party guests at the Van Tassels include African-Americans, and there&#39;s a glimpse of a generic Native American earlier on - but burly &#34;rantipole hero&#34; Brom Bones looks rightly massive next to the exaggeratedly gawky figure of Ichabod Crane. The Headless Horseman not only sports a particularly eerie-looking twig between its shoulders but rides a red-eyed, demonic steed, and in three views on the final page the decayed schoolhouse has a decidedly haunted air. Still, this is not a particularly scary rendition, and because its text is chopped into scattered, easily digestible passages tucked between or inside the panels, it may have more appeal to less-able readers than full versions.

As they created larger societies, however, inequality rose, and by 2500 bce truly egalitarian societies were on the wane. In <i>The Creation of Inequality,</i> Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus demonstrate that this development was not simply the result of population increase, food surplus, or the accumulation of valuables. Instead, inequality resulted from conscious manipulation of the unique social logic that lies at the core of every human group. </p><p> </p><p> A few societies allowed talented and ambitious individuals to rise in prestige while still preventing them from becoming a hereditary elite. But many others made high rank hereditary, by manipulating debts, genealogies, and sacred lore. At certain moments in history, intense competition among leaders of high rank gave rise to despotic kingdoms and empires in the Near East, Egypt, Africa, Mexico, Peru, and the Pacific. </p><p> </p><p> Drawing on their vast knowledge of both living and prehistoric social groups, Flannery and Marcus describe the changes in logic that create larger and more hierarchical societies, and they argue persuasively that many kinds of inequality can be overcome by reversing these changes, rather than by violence.</p></p><p>Kent Flannery is James B. Griffin Distinguished University Professor of Anthropological Archaeology and Curator, Environmental Archaeology, Museum of Anthropology, at the University of Michigan.The origin of inequality is one of the most basic questions about human societies. We all arose from egalitarian hunter/gatherer ancestors. Why, then, do almost all of us poor peasants now tolerate affluent leaders, whether they are democratically elected presidents or military dictators? In this clear, readable survey, the distinguished archaeologists <b>Kent Flannery</b> and <b>Joyce Marcus</b> extract the answers by comparing the histories of societies over the whole world for the last 10,000 years.

Nor does it proceed from a view that the New Testament was written as theology. We must bear in mind that the writers of the New Testament books were not writing set theological pieces. They were concerned with the needs of the churches for which they wrote. Those churches already had the Old Testament, but these new writings became in time the most significant part of the Scriptures of the believing community. As such, they should be studied in their own right, and these questions should be asked: What do these writings mean? What is the theology they express or imply?

Interpretive chapters shed light on the nuances of each case, the individuals involved, and the social, political, and cultural context at that particular moment in history. Discussing cases from nearly every decade in a two-hundred-year span, Melvin I. Urofsky expounds on the political climate of the United States from the country's infancy through the new millennium. Featuring Marbury v. Madison, Dred Scott v. Sandford, Miranda v. Arizona, Brown v. Board of Education, and many more, this text covers foundational rulings and more recent decisions. Written with students in mind, Melvin I. Urofsky's voice offers compelling and fascinating accounts of American legal milestones.</p><p>Melvin I UrofskyThis is a terrific book. It succeeds in placing each case in historical perspective and in bringing to life the individuals who were involved. Urofsky is thoughtful, fair-minded, and balanced, and yet does not hesitate to offer his own judgment about the cases and the decisions. Superbly well done.&#x201d;<br> <b>Richard Polenberg, Cornell University</b><br><br> The writing is very accessible and Urofsky shows that real people with often complex histories are involved in Supreme Court cases.&#x201d;<br> <b>John E.

The government has tried and failed to control it, and its revolutionary nature is trumpeted loudly by its backers. The Internet? Nope, the humble telegraph fit this bill way back in the 1800s. The parallels between the now-ubiquitous Internet and the telegraph are amazing, offering insight into the ways new technologies can change the very fabric of society within a single generation. In <i>The Victorian Internet</i>, Tom Standage examines the history of the telegraph, beginning with a horrifically funny story of a mile-long line of monks holding a wire and getting simultaneous shocks in the interest of investigating electricity, and ending with the advent of the telephone. All the early "online" pioneers are here: Samuel Morse, Thomas Edison, and a seemingly endless parade of code-makers, entrepreneurs, and spies who helped ensure the success of this communications revolution. Fans of <i>Longitude</i> will enjoy another story of the human side of dramatic technological developments, complete with personal rivalry, vicious competition, and agonizing failures. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Tom Standage</b> is the former technology editor and current business editor at the<i> Economist</i>.

However, it has been written in clear laymen&#x2019;s language for nonscientists who have serious interest in paleontology. Author Henry Gee provides naturalists&#x2019; notes on more than 50 different dinosaur species. His information is supplemented with dramatic, anatomically accurate full-color illustrations of each dinosaur. Material in this book is based on findings of dinosaur remains in North and South America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Antarctica, and is divided according to time periods: Triassic, Jurassic, Early- and Mid-Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous. At-a-glance icons convey key information about each animal, including size, taxonomy, geological period of origin, and geographical location of discovered bones. The book also presents general background information on the 180 million years of the dinosaur-dominated Mesozoic era, including details on Mesozoic plants and animals and the modern story of dinosaur discovery. More than 500<br><br>vivid illustrations are all in full color.</p><p>[Back Cover]<br> Renowned dinosaur artist Luis V. Rey and paleontologist and writer Henry Gee use up-to-the minute research findings to paint a vivid picture of the dinosaurs' world.

Modern dinosaur finds encompass far more than just bones, and currently take account of eggs, footprints, skin impressions, and in some cases, feathers. Today's paleontologists use biochemistry to learn what dinosaurs ate, and they study fossil bones to understand how those animals grew. Modern science also employs engineering design techniques to work out how dinosaurs fed, for instance demonstrating from skull structure and density that Tyrannosaurus was a bone-crushing butcher, while Allosaurus ripped and slashed flesh from its fleeing prey. <br><br> The latest dinosaur findings present a far more vivid and complete picture of this extraordinarily successful group of animals than would have been thought possible only a few years ago. Recent finds in South America, Madagascar, Mongolia, China, and Australia have revealed the existence of amazing and exotic dinosaurs. Some of the most remarkable finds in these recently explored territories include feathered dinosaurs from China, as well as a sauropod dinosaur nesting ground in Patagonia that stretches for miles in every direction. Our knowledge of dinosaurs is richer today than ever before, with no sign of the excitement lessening or the flood of new finds drying up. Paleontologist Henry Gee and artist Luis Rey have seamlessly integrated all of the most recent discoveries in the making of this unique book. <b>Henry Gee</b> is a renowned and thought-provoking science writer, and the author of<i> In Search of Deep Time</i> and <i> Jacob's Ladder.</i> Trained as a paleontologist, he is a senior editor of <i> Nature, </i> the weekly journal of science, where many of the dinosaur discoveries described in this book made their scientific debuts. <br> <b>Luis V.

According to the International Military Tribunal, during the ensuing massacre 20,000 Chinese men of military age were killed and approximately 20,000 cases of rape occurred; in all, the total number of people killed in and around the city of Nanjing was about 200,000. This carefully researched, intelligent collection of original essays considers the post-World War II treatment in China of the Nanjing Massacre and Japan. The book examines how the issue has developed as a political and diplomatic controversy in the five decades since World War II.<br><br>In his introduction, Joshua A. Fogel raises the significant moral and historiographical issues that frame the other essays. Mark Eykholt then provides an account of postwar Chinese responses to the massacre. Takashi Yoshida assesses the attempts to downplay the incident and its effects, providing a revealing analysis of Japanese debates over Japan's role in the world and the continuing ambivalence of many Japanese toward their defeat in World War II. In the concluding essay, Daqing Yang widens the scope of the discussion by comparing the Nanjing historiographic debates to similar debates in Germany over the nature of the Holocaust.</p><p><b>Joshua A.

Cash's <em>The Mind of the South</em> and C. Vann Woodward's <em>The Strange Career of Jim Crow</em>. Representing 20 years of research and writing on the history of the South, <em>The Crucible of Race</em> explores the large topic of Southern race relations for a span of a century and a half. Oxford is pleased to make available an abridgement of this parent volume: <em>A Rage for Order</em> preserves all the theme lines that were advanced in the original volume and many of the individual stories. As in <em>Crucible of Race</em>, Williamson here confronts the awful irony that the war to free blacks from slavery also freed racism. He examines the shift in the power base of Southern white leadership after 1850 and recounts the terrible violence done to blacks in the name of self-protection. This condensation of one of the most important interpretations of Southern history is offered as a means by which a large audience can grasp the essentials of black-white relations--a problem that persists to this day and one with which we all must contend--North and South, black and white.<br></p><p>Joel Williamson is Lineberger Professor in the Humanities at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.<br>"Excellent--I am adopting this for a course on the New South."--L.

Instead of emphasizing the naval arms race, which has been extensively studied before, Herrmann draws on documentary research in military and state archives in Germany, France, Austria, England, and Italy to show the previously unexplored effects of changes in the strength of the European armies during this period. Herrmann&#39;s work provides not only a contribution to debates about the causes of the war but also an account of how the European armies adopted the new weaponry of the twentieth century in the decade before 1914, including quick-firing artillery, machine guns, motor transport, and aircraft. In a narrative account that runs from the beginning of a series of international crises in 1904 until the outbreak of the war, Herrmann points to changes in the balance of military power to explain why the war began in 1914, instead of at some other time. Russia was incapable of waging a European war in the aftermath of its defeat at the hands of Japan in 1904-5, but in 1912, when Russia appeared to be regaining its capacity to fight, an unprecedented land-armaments race began. Consequently, when the July crisis of 1914 developed, the atmosphere of military competition made war a far more likely outcome than it would have been a decade earlier.</p><p><b>David G. Herrmann</b> is Assistant Professor of History at Tulane University.Herrmann's cogent study reveals how the perceptions of comparative military strength affected strategic and political planning among the Great Powers between 1904 and 1914, leading to a spiraling arms race. He describes the development of European armies during the Bosnia-Herzegovina annexation crisis and the Balkan wars (1912 and 1913); and he shows the increasingly vital importance of technological advances?including the machine gun, deadlier artillery, the airplane, motor vehicles and the telephone?to policymakers in Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Russia and Italy. The balance of military power, Herrmann contends, was so volatile by August 1914 that statesmen in Berlin and Vienna chose to launch a "preventive war" before the coalition among France, Britain and Russia became invincible. His scholarly analysis is a model of insight into crisis politics, war-drum diplomacy and the destabilizing effect of an arms competition on international relations.

It was one of the very first--and still remains one of the best--dissections of the wildly destructive rock &amp; roll lifestyle. <i>Stalking the Nightmare</i> is a 1982 collection of assorted short stories and essays, which also boasts an insightful foreword by Ellison admirer Stephen King.

One of the "Antwerp group of six" who changed the face of contemporary fashion, Margiela created 41 runway shows between 1989 and 2009 which promoted a unique vision of understated luxury -- monochromes, oversize volumes, and his signature "constructed-deconstructed" cuts - whose credo is comfort, timelessness, sensuality, and authenticity.<br>Famously reclusive, Margiela never showed his face even at his own shows in order that the work could stand purely on its own, free from any link to celebrity or self-promotion. This volume chronicles these amazing fashion shows in careful detail: the extraordinary spaces, the music, the designer's intentions, the iconic pieces. Over the years, recurring motifs and inspirations become more apparent including anonymity, whiteness, past and anteriority, diversion. The book reveals the sensitive, poetic and incredibly innovative universe of this most influential contemporary fashion designer.</p><p><b>Alexandre Samson</b> is a curator and manages the Palais Galliera contemporary collections. <br><br><b>Olivier Saillard</b> is a noted fashion historian and author and was the director of the Palais Galliera from 2010 until 2017.

Run by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld (known for their roles in the O.J. Simpson murder trial), the project has thus far managed to free 43 wrongly convicted people and has taken on the cases of over 200 more. In <i>Actual Innocence</i>, Scheck, Neufeld, and Pulitzer-winning columnist Jim Dwyer tell the stories of 10 of the men they have helped. How did these men wind up in prison--some on death row--for rapes and murders they didn't commit? The causes range from mistaken identification by the victims to sloppy police work--and, in some cases, outright dereliction of duty or fabrication of evidence. Far too often, cops lock on to their suspect early and decide that their instincts can't possibly be wrong--an attitude that can persist even after the falsely accused has been exonerated. "If he is innocent," says one investigator of a man who spent seven years in prison, "I wish him a good life, but I will have no remorse for him. I have no remorse for anyone that I have ever arrested."<p> Though the writing is not always graceful, what matters in <i>Actual Innocence</i> is not the quality of the prose but the importance of the Innocence Project's work. Scheck and Neufeld's commitment to justice is evident in each of these stories, and the problems they force us to address--not just concerning the imprisonment of innocent people but in restoring their lives upon release--cannot be ignored.</p>"<b>Actual Innocence</b> is a gut-wrenching, terrifying, hair-raising account of how fatally wrong things can go inside the American criminal justice system.

Yet the critical question facing America remains unanswered: What should be the nation's global strategy for maintaining its exceptional position in the world? Zbigniew Brzezinski tackles this question head-on in this incisive and pathbreaking book. <i>The Grand Chessboard</i> presents Brzezinski's bold and provocative geostrategic vision for American preeminence in the twenty-first century. Central to his analysis is the exercise of power on the Eurasian landmass, which is home to the greatest part of the globe's population, natural resources, and economic activity. Stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait, from Lapland to Malaysia, Eurasia is the &#x201d;grand chessboard&#x201d; on which America's supremacy will be ratified and challenged in the years to come. The task facing the United States, he argues, is to manage the conflicts and relationships in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East so that no rival superpower arises to threaten our interests or our well-being.The heart of <i>The Grand Chessboard</i> is Brzezinski's analysis of the four critical regions of Eurasia and of the stakes for America in each arena Europe, Russia, Central Asia, and East Asia. The crucial fault lines may seem familiar, but the implosion of the Soviet Union has created new rivalries and new relationships, and Brzezinski maps out the strategic ramifications of the new geopolitical realities. He explains, for example: Why France and Germany will play pivotal geostrategic roles, whereas Britain and Japan will not. Why NATO expansion offers Russia the chance to undo the mistakes of the past, and why Russia cannot afford to toss this opportunity aside. Why the fate of Ukraine and Azerbaijan are so important to America. Why viewing China as a menace is likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why America is not only the first truly global superpower but also the last and what the implications are for America's legacy. Brzezinski's surprising and original conclusions often turn conventional wisdom on its head as he lays the groundwork for a new and compelling vision of America's vital interests. Once, again, Zbigniew Brzezinski provides our nation with a philosophical and practical guide for maintaining and managing our hard-won global power.</p><p><b>Zbigniew Brzezinski</b>, the National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, is a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor of American foreign policy at the School of Advanced International Studies, the Johns Hopkins University, both located in Washington, D.C. His many books include <i>The Choice</i> and <i>The Grand Chessboard</i> . He lives in Washington, D.C.The former national security advisor is still a believer in geopolitics after all these years. Like most foreign-policy aficionados weaned on the Cold War, Brzezinski (Out of Control, 1993) has been forced by the disintegration of the Soviet Union to broaden his perspective--but not very far. He sees the US as the only global superpower, but inability to maintain its hegemony indefinitely means that ``geostrategic skill'' is essential. To what end is not specified beyond the vague shaping of ``a truly cooperative global community'' that is in ``the fundamental interests of humankind,'' but in this genre, goals are commonly assumed rather than examined. In any case, Brzezinski casts Eurasia as the playing field upon which the world's fate is determined and analyzes the possibilities in Europe, the former Soviet Union, the Balkans (interpreted broadly), and the Far East. Like a grandmaster in chess, he plots his strategy several moves in advance, envisioning a three-stage development. Geopolitical pluralism must first be promoted to defuse challenges to America, then compatible international partners must be developed to encourage cooperation under American leadership, and finally the actual sharing of international political responsibility can be considered. The twin poles of this strategy are a united Europe in the West and China in the East; the central regions are more problematic and, for Brzezinski, not as critical in constructing a stable balance of power. This updated version of East-West geopolitics is worth taking seriously but it is also an amazing example of how a perspective can be revised without actually being rethought.

The truth and comfort of these familiar words spring to life in this excerpted gift edition of W. Phillip Keller&#39;s classic work, A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23. Based on his years as a keeper of sheep, Keller infuses new hope and meaning into our relationship with Christ, the Good Shepherd. As we lie down in green pastures or walk through the shadowy valley, we&#39;re assured that whatever our path, whatever our stumbling, the Shepherd will lovingly guide, carry, and protect us. We can depend on His goodness and mercy all the days of our lives.</p><p>The late W. Phillip Keller was born in East Africa and always loved the out-of-doors. He was trained in agronomy and subsequently spent many years on ranches in British Columbia. He lived among and observed sheep and their relationship to the shepherd. Out of this rich, practical experience, came the best-selling book from which this book was excerpted.&#39;The Lord Is My Shepherd&#39; The Lord! But who is the Lord? What is His character? Does He have adequate credentials to be my Shepherd---my manager---my owner? And if He does---how do I come under His control? In what way do I become the object of His concern and diligent care? These are penetrating, searching questions, and they deserve honest and basic examination. One of the calamities of Christianity is our tendency to talk in ambiguous generalities. David, the author of the poem, himself a shepherd and the son of a shepherd, later to be known as the &#39;Shepherd King&#39; of Israel, stated explicitly, &#39;The Lord is my Shepherd.&#39; To whom did he refer? He referred to Jehovah, the Lord God of Israel. His statement was confirmed by Jesus the Christ. When He was God incarnate amongst men, He declared emphatically, &#39;I am the good Shepherd.&#39; But who was this Christ? Our view of Him is often too small---too cramped---too provincial---too human. And because it is, we feel unwilling to allow Him to have authority or control---much less outright ownership of our lives. He it was who was directly responsible for the creation of all things both natural and supernatural (see Colossians 1:15--20). If we pause to reflect on the person of Christ---on His power and His achievements---suddenly like David we will be glad to state proudly, &#39;The Lord---He is my Shepherd!&#39; But before we do this it helps to hold clearly in mind the particular part played upon our history by God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. God the Father is God the author---the originator of all that exists. It was in His mind, first, that all took shape. God the Son, our Saviour, is God the artisan---the artist, the Creator of all that exists. He brought into being all that had been originally formulated in His Father&#39;s mind. God the Holy Spirit is God the agent who presents these facts to both my mind and my spiritual understanding so that they become both real and relative to me as an individual. Now the beautiful relationships given to us repeatedly in Scripture between God and man are those of a father to his children and a shepherd to his sheep. These concepts were first conceived in the mind of God our Father. They were made possible and practical through the work of Christ. They are confirmed and made real in me through the agency of the gracious Holy Spirit. So when the simple---though sublime---statement is made by a man or woman that &#39;The Lord is my Shepherd,&#39; it immediately implies a profound yet practical working relationship between a human being and his Maker. It links a lump of common clay to divine destiny---it means a mere mortal becomes the cherished object of divine diligence. This thought alone should stir my spirit, quicken my own sense of awareness, and lend enormous dignity to myself as an individual. To think that God in Christ is deeply concerned about me as a particular person immediately gives great purpose and enormous meaning to my short sojourn upon this planet. And the greater, the wider, the more majestic my concept is of the Christ---the more vital will be my relationship to Him. Obviously, David, in this Psalm, is speaking not as the shepherd, though he was one, but as a sheep; one of the flock. He spoke with a strong sense of pride and devotion and admiration. It was as though he literally boasted aloud, &#39;Look at who my shepherd is---my owner---my manager!&#39; The Lord is! After all, he knew from firsthand experience that the lot in life of any particular sheep depended on the type of man who owned it. Some men were gentle, kind, intelligent, brave, and selfless in their devotion to their stock. Under one man sheep would struggle, starve, and suffer endless hardship. In another&#39;s care they would flourish and thrive contentedly. So if the Lord is my Shepherd I should know something of His character and understand something of His ability. To meditate on this I frequently go out at night to walk alone under the stars and remind myself of His majesty and might. Looking up at the star-studded sky I remember that at least 250,000,000 x 250,000,000 such bodies---each larger than our sun, one of the smallest of the stars---have been scattered across the vast spaces of the universe by His hand. I recall that the planet earth, which is my temporary home for a few short years, is so minute a speck of matter in space that if it were possible to transport our most powerful telescope to our nearest neighbor star, Alpha Centauri, and look back this way, the earth could not be seen, even with the aid of that powerful instrument. All this is a bit humbling. It drains the &#39;ego&#39; from a man and puts things in proper perspective. It makes me see myself as a mere mite of material in an enormous universe. Yet the staggering fact remains that Christ, the Creator of such an enormous universe of overwhelming magnitude, deigns to call Himself my Shepherd and invites me to consider myself His sheep---His special object of affection and attention. Who better could care for me? By the same sort of process I stoop down and pick up a handful of soil from the backyard or roadside. Placing it under an electron microscope I am astounded to discover it teems with billions upon billions of micro-organisms. Many of them are so complex in their own peculiar cellular structure that even a fraction of their functions in the earth are not yet properly understood. Yes, He the Christ---the Son of God ---brought all of this into being. From the most gigantic galaxy to the most minute microbe, all function flawlessly in accordance with definite laws of order and unity which are utterly beyond the mind of finite man to master.</p><h2>Communism: A History (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p>From one of our greatest historians, a magnificent reckoning with the modern world's most fateful idea.<br><br>With astonishing authority and clarity, Richard Pipes has fused a lifetime's scholarship into a single focused history of Communism, from its hopeful birth as a theory to its miserable death as a practice. <br><br>At its heart, the book is a history of the Soviet Union, the most comprehensive reorganization of human society ever attempted by a nation-state. Drawing on much new information, Richard Pipes explains the country�s evolution from the 1917 revolution to the Great Terror and World War II, global expansion and the Cold War chess match with the United States, and the regime's decline and ultimate collapse. There is no more dramatic story in modern history, nor one more crucial to master, than that of how the writing and agitation of two mid-nineteenth-century European thinkers named Marx and Engels led to a great and terrible world religion that brought down a mighty empire, consumed the world in conflict, and left in its wake a devastation whose full costs can only now be tabulated.</p><p>As Harvard University professor Richard Pipes shows in <i>Communism: A Brief History</i>, the tragedy of Communism is that its history was anything but brief. For most of the 20th century, it held much of the globe in its fatal grip: The utopian ideology is responsible for nearly 100 million deaths, which is 50 percent more than the number of people killed in the two world wars combined. "Communism was not a good idea that went wrong; it was a bad idea," writes Pipes, who is also the author of <i>The Russian Revolution</i> and <i>Property and Freedom</i>. <p> This compelling little book is a devastating critique of Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, and everything else that fits under the awful rubric of Communism. It begins by tracing Communism's philosophical origins (it has antecedents in Plato) and then outlines the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Next comes the story of why Communism took root in Russia and not the industrial West, where Marx himself believed it would sprout (answer: the traditions of property rights and the rule of law were too strong). Even in Russia, Communism was not the product of popular demand (in fact, it has never been the product of popular demand anywhere). Instead, it was a top-down revolution imposed on the whole country by a small minority of elites, led by Lenin. The Communists claimed to represent workers, but few workers were actually a part of their movement. Thus, "the Communists had to rule despotically and violently; they could never afford to relax their authority." And they were capable of incredible cruelty: "The so-called purges of the 1930s were a terror campaign that in indiscriminate ferocity and number of victims had no parallel in world history." In 1937 and 1938, for instance, the Soviet rulers of Russia executed an average of 1,000 people per day; the tsarist regime they supplanted, which was often criticized as inhumane, executed less than 4,000 people for political crimes over an 85-year period. </p><p> Though Pipes appropriately spends much time discussing the Soviet Union, he also examines Communism's reception in the West and in developing countries. The book is a concise tour de force. As the cold war fades into history, it is critical not to forget the monstrous legacy of Communism, whose horrible record Pipes lays out on these pages. This is a magnificent book, a wonderful primer on a topic whose importance is difficult to overstate. <i>--John Miller</i></p>&#x201c;In the name of great good, Communism has brought great evil. . . . If you&#x2019;ve wondered how your children and grandchildren are going to grasp this large and alien reality, a good move is to make sure they own this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Weekly Standard</i><br><br>&#x201c;The publication of Richard Pipes&#x2019; <i>Communism: A History</i> . . . is of signal im-portance.

The book opens with an explanation of engineering, introduces the different types of engineers, and describes the problem-solving process they use. Canals and dams are given center stage as their structures and the scientific principles behind them are explained, history and examples are given, and disasters caused by or resulting from their construction or aging are shared. Each section is accompanied by several activities, and that's where things begin to crumble. Many of the activities do a fine job of showcasing the information from the preceding section but explanations are often inadequate or directions and illustrations lack clarity. One example: buoyancy is described as a "force that allows an object to float in liquid." Volume and displacement are introduced and Archimedes's principle is mentioned but density is overlooked until the activities section when a foam and cardboard barge are compared and a Cartesian diver is made-all requiring density to help explain buoyancy. Other activities have tenuous connections to the preceding topic or sometimes seem random. A "Spinning Bucket Trick" mentions centrifugal force in relation to the canals in Venice but doesn't explain the science or make the connection to canals. And so it goes. Quotes, spot black-and-white illustrations, "Did You Know" boxes, and definitions for vocabulary used on the page fill out the spreads. The topic plus the hands-on emphasis is a nod to the growing popularity of STEM initiatives in education but unfortunately this title needs some shoring up.-Carol S.

The history of Wal-Mart uncovers a complex network that united Sun Belt entrepreneurs, evangelical employees, Christian business students, overseas missionaries, and free-market activists. Through the stories of people linked by the world&#x2019;s largest corporation, Bethany Moreton shows how a Christian service ethos powered capitalism at home and abroad. </p><p> While industrial America was built by and for the urban North, rural Southerners comprised much of the labor, management, and consumers in the postwar service sector that raised the Sun Belt to national influence. These newcomers to the economic stage put down the plough to take up the bar-code scanner without ever passing through the assembly line. Industrial culture had been urban, modernist, sometimes radical, often Catholic and Jewish, and self-consciously international. Post-industrial culture, in contrast, spoke of Jesus with a drawl and of unions with a sneer, sang about Momma and the flag, and preached salvation in this world and the next. </p><p> This extraordinary biography of Wal-Mart&#x2019;s world shows how a Christian pro-business movement grew from the bottom up as well as the top down, bolstering an economic vision that sanctifies corporate globalization. </p><p> The author has assigned her royalties and subsidiary earnings to Interfaith Worker Justice (www.iwj.org) and its local affiliate in Athens, GA, the Economic Justice Coalition (www.econjustice.org). </p></p><p>Bethany Moreton is Assistant Professor of History and Women&#x2019;s Studies at the University of Georgia.This brilliant book could well become one of the most talked about nonfiction books of 2009&#x2013;certainly among those who helped bring in the Obama era and likely among their opponents as well.<br> --Nancy MacLean, author of <i>Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace</i><br><br>A fascinating portrait of the interconnections of commerce, spirituality, and government in modern society. Moreton treats Wal-Mart as a great whale of a corporation that gathered religious and political significance as it traveled from Bentonville, Arkansas, throughout the US, on to Mexico, and to every corner of the globe.<br> --Walter A. Friedman, Harvard Business School<br><br>Startlingly original, creatively researched, and forcefully argued, this beautifully written book tells a compelling story about a crucially important player in modern American life.<br> --Bruce J. Schulman, co-editor of <i>Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s</i><br><br><i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> is a landmark study. Moreton's subtle blend of economic and cultural history compels us to rethink the history and geography of modern America. Revelations abound on every page. <br> --Jean-Christophe Agnew, Yale University<br><br>Moreton unearths the roots of the seeming anomaly of "corporate populism," in a timely and penetrating analysis that situates the rise of Wal-Mart in a postwar confluence of forces, from federal redistribution of capital favoring the rural South and West to the "family values" symbolized by Sam Walton's largely white, rural, female workforce (the basis of a new economic and ideological niche), the New Christian Right's powerful probusiness and countercultural movement of the 1970s and '80s and its harnessing of electoral power. Giving Max Weber's "Protestant ethic" something of a late-20th-century update, Moreton shows how this confluence wedded Christianity to the free market. Moreton's erudition and clear prose elucidate much in the area of recent labor and political history, while capturing the centrality of movement cultures in the evolving face of American populism. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2009-03-16)<br><br>[A] probing and nuanced study of the latter-day evangelical romance with free-market capitalism...Wal-Mart's folksy illusion relied in part on making store workers feel like family; in particular, on making female workers feel valued as wives and mothers. Moreton does an excellent job of digging beneath Wal-Mart's carefully imagineered vision of the rural good life. She not only recounts labor abuses such as the company's notorious failure to promote and reward women but also stresses how the company appealed to white Americans' feelings of entitlement...Its workers and the customers they served--often "friends, neighbors, and loved ones"--were the same: white Ozarkers nostalgic for a wholesome, more homogeneous, and largely imaginary yesteryear, for a past in which the best opportunities were reserved for people like them.<br> --Maud Newton (<i>Bookforum</i> 2009-06-01)<br><br>Like all historians who love their craft, Bethany Moreton is a gifted storyteller, and this book offers readers an engaging account of how a discount five-and-dime store conceived in the rural American Ozarks became the template for service work in the global economy...[An] impeccably documented and eloquently argued narrative, which will interest historians, sociologists and general readers...Her most significant contribution is to offer an explanation of the paradox that political pundits have pondered in recent years: why many middle Americans prioritize conservative social issues ahead of government policies that would presumably be in their economic self-interest. Moreton's careful, sometimes wry historical analysis demonstrates that when "values voters"--with many Wal-Mart workers surely among them--eschew economic benefits such as unionization, they do so out of allegiance to a radically new set of moral market priorities. The subjugation of the self to the global corporation, ironically, embraces a deeper set of ideals about the supremacy of family, the morality of self-reliance and the evangelical justification of free enterprise. <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> shows just how deeply entrenched these ideals are in the world's largest retailer, offering an intimate portrait of both the contradictions and conquests of the new service economy.<br> --Rebekah Peeples Massengill (<i>Times Higher Education</i> 2009-05-28)<br><br>Fascinating...With verve and clarity, Moreton offers something more distinctive: a compelling explanation of how Wal-Mart captured the hearts and pocketbooks of so many Americans.<br> --Steven P. Miller (<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> 2009-06-07)<br><br>Bethany Moreton's <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise</i> views the company as product of its region, showing that its success has depended on a bizarre reconciliation of Northwest Arkansas's uneasy cocktail of anti-corporate populism, racial homogeneity, evangelical Christianity, and free enterprise...The mega-retailer is significant not only as a business success story but as an ideological triumph for the right. Bethany Moreton charts this triumph brilliantly.<br> --Liza Featherstone (<i>The Big Money</i> 2009-06-22)<br><br>Bethany Moreton's pathbreaking study, <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise</i> is an invaluable asset for apprehending how we got here. Her new book chronicles Wal-Mart's role in mainstreaming evangelical and free market values even as it became the world's largest public corporation and the nation's biggest private employer. A critical appraisal of how religion, politics and economics were interwoven in post-Vietnam American culture and society, <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> is also a bracing reminder that we, among the most materialistic people in the world, have turned a blind eye to the impact of material conditions on our actions, attitudes and beliefs.<br> --Diane Winston (<i>Religion Dispatches</i> 2009-06-21)</p><h2>ASTRO 3 (with ASTRO 3 Online Printed Access Card) (New, Engaging Titles from 4LTR Press)</h2><p>Based on cutting-edge research of student study preferences and workflows, ASTRO 3 equips you with your ideal combination of print and digital resources to help you maximize your course success.

In Defiance, Nechama Tec offers a riveting history of one such group, a forest community in western Belorussia that would number more than 1,200 Jews by 1944-the largest armed rescue operation of Jews by Jews in World War II. Tec reveals that this extraordinary community included both men and women, some with weapons, but mostly unarmed, ranging from infants to the elderly. She reconstructs for the first time the amazing details of how these partisans and their families-hungry, exposed to the harsh winter weather-managed not only to survive, but to offer protection to all Jewish fugitives who could find their way to them. Arguing that this success would have been unthinkable without the vision of one man, Tec offers penetrating insight into the group&#39;s commander, Tuvia Bielski. Tec brings to light the untold story of Bielski&#39;s struggle as a partisan who lost his parents, wife, and two brothers to the Nazis, yet never wavered in his conviction that it was more important to save one Jew than to kill twenty Germans. She shows how, under Bielski&#39;s guidance, the partisans smuggled Jews out of heavily guarded ghettos, scouted the roads for fugitives, and led retaliatory raids against Belorussian peasants who collaborated with the Nazis. Herself a Holocaust survivor, Nechama Tec here draws on wide-ranging research and never before published interviews with surviving partisans-including Tuvia Bielski himself-to reconstruct here the poignant and unforgettable story of those who chose to fight. &#34;The saga of the Bielski partisans is one of the most elevating and inspiring stories in the chronicle of death and despair that is the Holocaust. . .Defiance is an accomplished and startling work of Holocaust documentation.&#34; -Los Angeles Times &#34;Powerful and meticulous.

Rudnicki&#39;s clear presentation helps the listener navigate the densely packed historical material. One of his greatest strengths is his ease with the language of the story&#39;s setting. His pronunciation of names and his use of the slightest of accents when rendering the passages of dialogue are completely authentic and comfortable. The material itself is riveting as the author tells the little-known story of three brave peasant brothers who refused to bow to the demands of the Nazis. Instead, they started a movement to rescue fellow Jews from the ghettos and death squads, and establish a flourishing society in the forests of eastern Poland.

Theoreticians, on the other hand, rarely test their ideas with empirical projects. As this groundbreaking volume makes clear, however, neither data nor theory alone is adequate to the task of social explanation&#x2015;rather they form and inform each other as the inquiry process unfolds. <em>Theory and Educational Research</em> bridges the age-old theory/research divide by demonstrating how researchers can use critical social theory to determine appropriate empirical research strategies, and extend the analytical, critical &#x2013; and sometimes emancipatory &#x2013; power of data gathering and interpretation. </p> <p></p> <p>Each chapter models a theoretically informed empiricism that places the data research yields in constant conversation with theoretical arsenals of powerful concepts. Personal reflections following each chapter chronicle the contributors&#x2019; trajectories of struggle and triumph utilizing theory and its powers in research. In the end this rich collection teaches education scholars how to deliberately engage with critical social theory in research to produce work that is simultaneously theoretically inspired, politically engaged, and empirically evocative. </p></p><p><p><strong>Jean Anyon</strong> is Professor of Social and Educational Policy in the Urban Education Doctoral Program at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. </p><p>"This volume scrubs the mystique off social theories, making them accessible and even agreeable to a much wider audience, thus opening up immeasurable opportunities for future creative application.

This book examines the evolution of the concept. It shows that late-eighteenth-century North Americans came to believe that their society was composed of biologically exclusive and permanently unequal human groups, each with distinctive behavioral, moral, spiritual, and intellectual characteristics, led people to see biophysical and behavioral features as innate and immutable. In the nineteenth century, differences between whites, American Indians, and blacks were magnified in the popular mind and in scholarly writings to the point that these groups were seen as separate species, justifying the preservation of racial&#x201d; slavery and the subsequent dehumanization of freed blacks. With the application in the late nineteenth century of the racial worldview to European peoples and the subsequent twentieth-century inhumanity and brutality of Nazi race ideology, the concept of race came under attack. Liberal ideology coupled with advances in science prompted criticism of race&#x201d; and efforts to eliminate the term from the lexicon of science.In a sweeping work that traces the idea of race through three centuries of North American history, Audrey Smedley shows race to be a cultural construct used variously and opportunistically throughout time, although the scientific record shows little common agreement on its meaning. Tracing the social and historical processes that helped shape the idea of race, Smedley argues that race was and is a folk worldview, fabricated as an existential reality out of elements of English cultural history and the conquest and enslavement of physically distinct populations. The schism between science and popular thought on race, which appeared in the mid-twentieth century, continues today. If progressive scientists no longer accept the biological idea of race, will society eventually also reject it?The second edition expands its coverage of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, particularly in matters of IQ testing and changing racial attitudes, including the contemporary movement aimed at identifying a mixed race&#x201d; category in the U.S. census. Smedley further examines the economic, social, and political factors after World War II that directly or indirectly affected the public's thinking about race and discusses how the Civil Rights Movement and television during the 1950s and 1960s prompted greater attention to race and racism, causing many to rethink their beliefs and values. The first edition was named a 1994 Outstanding Book on Human Rights in North America by the Gustavus Myers Center.</p><p><b>Audrey Smedley</b> is professor emerita of anthropology and African American studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.In this fourth edition, Drs.

Deeply thoughtful, and vibrantly informed by Meadows' lived encounters with virtual worlds, the book makes a compelling case for extending the concept of the avatar beyond the boundaries of those worlds, across the full range of digitally mediated experience, and into the core of what makes us human."<br> - Julian Dibbell, author of "Play Money: Or How I Quit My Day Job and Made Millions Trading Virtual Loot"<br> <br> "Mark Meadow's virtual creatures are not your next door neighbours--or are they? Leaving behind 1990s cyberculture and its underground aesthetics, with Meadows we descend into a maelstrom of Identity 2.0 in which business, leasure, sexuality, labour and fashion melt into one."<br> - Geert Lovink, Media Theorist, Net Critic and Activist<br> <br> "In this sweeping and impressive work, Mark Meadows traces the history of online avatars and explores the profound roles that they play in our online lives by mediating our communication with others and contributing to our social interactions, activities, and group narratives. The work is thus not just about avatars, but ultimately about the strategies that humans use to present themselves when they communicate, work together, and play together. It will be an invaluable resource for disciplines ranging from virtual world design to narrative theory to sociology."<br> - Peter Ludlow, Professor of philosophy, University of Toronto, and co-author of The Second Life Herald.<br> <br> "Mark Meadows explores and explains one of the most intriguing phenomena of digital life: the fantastic (psychological) reproduction of a SELF who inhabits a range of virtual worlds. He narrates how our avatars/ourselves have co-evolved with the development of new virtual worlds, revealing new modes of human-becoming in a digital age."<br> - Anne Balsamo, Author, Designing Culture: The technological Imagination at Work and Professor, Interactive Media at USC<br> <br> "Mark Meadows is fully immersed in an evolving new culture and reporting back from the heart of the action. Ultimately, what he reports on isn't informing us about Second Life, World of Warcraft, or online chat rooms. Instead, what he reveals is a reflection of ourselves a the beginning of the 21st Century in all our weirdness, wonder, and humanity."<br> - Nathan Shedroff, Experience Strategist<br> <br> "What Bruce Chatwin did for the exotic far reaches of the physical world, Mark Stephen Meadows does for the virtual. "I, Avatar" is a richly informed and intensely personal set of travel dispatches from the thriving frontier that is Second Life. The author/artist's picaresque narrative records his journey through the construction of his online persona "pighed" as well as the shifting social contexts in differing online communities. The result is a thought-provoking and illuminating exploration of the social and philosophical underpinnings of perceived realities both physical and virtual."<br> - Maribeth Back, Senior Research Scientist, FX-PAL<br> <br> "I knew Mark Meadows was a weird mix: smart, adventurous, well-read, well-spoken, nerdy, but most of all open minded. He has managed to work all this into his book. That should tell you what kind of a trip this read is. If anyone was to bring something fresh to the table, it had to be Mark Meadows."<br> - Alexis Nolent, Ubisoft's Game System Story Director, and author of world-famous graphic novel "The Killer".<br> <br> "As anyone who has heard Mark Meadows speak on portraiture, interactivity and narrative knows, he connects with the imagination and intellect of his audience in a way that is both thrilling and artistic. Little wonder then that his new book, I, Avatar, connects with the reader in much the same way."<br> - Matt Costello, Co-creator of ZoogDisney and Writer of Doom 3 and The 7th Guest<br> <br> "Pighed takes us on a whirlwind road trip through this century's most exciting new medium, the exploding cyber-suburbs of virtual worlds inhabited by millions of avatars. Do you want to know how your avatar reflects back on you? Are you asking the question: where will this strange journey take us? Don't just stand there, the front seat is free, so get yourself strapped in for upload!"<br> - Bruce Damer, virtual worlds pioneer and author of "Avatars"<br> <br> "Avatars are fast becoming the main vehicle through which we navigate an ever more complex online landscape. Mark documents with vivid imagery the blurring line between our real and virtual identities, the multi-faceted ways in which we project ourselves into bodies ranging from a simple string of text to furry, phantasmagoric creatures.

But in The Other Side of Sadness, George Bonanno shows that our conventional model discounts our capacity for resilience. In fact, he reveals that we are already hardwired to deal with our losses efficiently&#x2014;not by graduating through static phases. Weaving in explorations of mourning rituals and the universal experiences of the death of a parent or child, Bonanno examines how our inborn emotions&#x2014;anger and denial, but also relief and joy&#x2014;help us deal effectively with loss. And grieving goes beyond mere sadness: it can deepen interpersonal connections and often involves positive experiences. In the end, mourning is not predictable, but incredibly sophisticated. Combining personal anecdotes and original research, The Other Side of Sadness is a must-read for those going through the death of a loved one, mental health professionals, and</p><p><b>George A.

Professor Watson has been a Woodrow Wilson Center Fellow, and he lectures widely in the United States and Abroad.&#34;I&#39;m quite amazed at what Watson has accomplished in his introduction.... I find his comparison of Jackson and Clay representing democracy and economic development to be very sound and intelligently and convincingly argued.

Arm-in-arm they marched, poured Coca-Cola into one another&#x2019;s eyes to blunt the effects of tear gas, ran from the security forces, and cursed the country&#x2019;s president, Bashar al-Assad. It was ecstasy. A long-bottled revolution was finally erupting, and freedom from a brutal dictator seemed, at last, imminent. Five years later, the three young friends were scattered: one now an Islamist revolutionary, another dead at the hands of government soldiers, and the last, Marwan, now a journalist in Turkish exile, trying to find a way back to a homeland reduced to rubble.<br><br> Marwan was there to witness and document firsthand the Syrian war, from its inception to the present. He watched from the rooftops as regime warplanes bombed soldiers; as revolutionary activist groups, for a few dreamy days, spray-painted hope on Raqqa; as his friends died or threw in their lot with Islamist fighters. He became a journalist by courageously tweeting out news from a city under siege by ISIS, the Russians, and the Americans all at once.

Our faces sting, so we wrap them in our T-shirts.<br><br>Until five minutes ago, we were chanting, &#x201c;If you have a conscience, join us,&#x201d; but now all we can manage is, &#x201c;Kus ukhtak, ya Bashar&#x201d;&#x2014;Hey Bashar, fuck your sister&#x2019;s cunt.<br><br>I see a gas canister on the ground. It leaks the same foul stuff that&#x2019;s making water stream from Tareq&#x2019;s eyes. I pick it up from the back end so that it won&#x2019;t burn me. My hand screams anyway. I throw it toward the line of riot cops. I don&#x2019;t know where it goes, but I grin anyway, exultant.<br><br>It is my first protest.<br><br>Fear is dead.<br><br>If a bullet hits me now, I&#x2019;ll feel no pain.<br><br>Ramadan is drawing to a close, taking with it the sourness of our childhoods, but in Syria, a revolution is being born. It has been six months since the first demonstrators hit Damascus&#x2019;s al-Hamidiyah neighborhood. Their protests consisted of defiant shouts and the sound of their sneakers skidding as they ran through twisted alleyways, the security forces close behind. Now protests bloom in most cities. The country is boiling, but aside from some tiny demonstrations, our Raqqa seems quiet&#x2014;a poor, uneducated city, lagging behind, just like it always has.<br><br>We are young this summer. I am twenty-two, Nael is twenty-four, and his brother Tareq is twenty-one. We grew up together; we played soccer in the dusty streets beneath the disapproving gaze of our parents. How we longed to escape&#x2014;and we did: I to study in Aleppo, Nael in Damascus, and Tareq in liberal, libertine Beirut. We are among the first of our families to attend university, but we are still failures in our fathers&#x2019; eyes, who only want us to rise to their level of achievement and no further&#x2014;they fear the victories we might win on our own.<br><br>Dusk is falling. The muezzin sings the Maghrib prayer to signal that we can break our fast. We haven&#x2019;t eaten since dawn, but food isn&#x2019;t what we are hungry for.<br><br>We want to shout our throats bloody. To force the sound of our voices into the most intimidating ears.<br><br>Every evening for weeks the same scene has played out at al-Mansouri Mosque in Raqqa. Several dozen protesters merge into the crowds that stream out after prayers. Taking advantage of their relative anonymity, the protesters shout slogans made famous in Egypt or Tunisia for a few thrilling minutes, then vanish into the side streets. For weeks, we&#x2019;ve known about these protests, and tonight, for the first time, we hurry to join them. I glance at Nael. His face shines with its usual nervous energy, fueled by the furnace inside him, and I think again that for Nael, the whole world will never be wide enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Our parents must not know,&#x201d; he whispers to me. He&#x2019;s right. Activists are trouble for their parents, especially if they&#x2019;re caught.<br><br>&#x201c;No one must know,&#x201d; I grumble back.<br><br>Soon we see more protesters. A few hold Syria&#x2019;s three-starred independence flag, while others wave signs scrawled in Arabic. Only God, Syria, Freedom. Death, but not humiliation. Word spreads that security forces have massed at a junction near the mosque, so we march instead through the nearby al-Hani passageway. We curse recklessly against the powers that be. &#x201c;Hey hey! This is Raqqa!&#x201d; we chant, claiming our city&#x2019;s place in the revolution.<br><br>In response, insults pour from every window and balcony. &#x201c;Sons of bitches!&#x201d; &#x201c;Go back to your parents&#x2019; house!&#x201d; the neighbors hiss. &#x201c;You have ruined this country!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;God curse you!&#x201d; one old woman screams, her face contorted with hate.<br><br>What can she know of our motives or those of the other protesters at these demonstrations blossoming irrepressibly across our country? Her rheumy eyes see nothing but a crowd of brats. To her we are stupid children, behaving badly, in need of our fathers&#x2019; fists. We will never forgive her, nor those like her, I think. &#x201c;Ingrate,&#x201d; I mutter in disgust.<br><br>I understand the rich not caring. The well-connected businessmen. The government employees who bought nice cars with the money they got from bribes. The regime turned out well for those people, so why would they spare a thought for others? But how can a working-class Raqqan ever allow him- or herself to be content? Nael told me that when a government keeps kicking people down, they get used to it. Life is shit, they think, and turn for happiness to their personal shit piles. Though we understand the mechanisms of control, neither Nael nor I can excuse this apathy. Even covered in blood, the protesters slaughtered during crackdowns in Homs and Dara&#x2019;a looked more alive than the zombies who curse us from their balconies. History might prove us wrong, but at least we could speak to the people killed when the regime tanks rolled into Deir ez-Zor mere weeks ago. Somewhere in your country, people cared for you, we could say to our rebellious dead.<br><br>We march for ten minutes before security finds us. They chase us, but we are too many, so they start firing the gas.<br><br>When the tear gas billows, political sentiments flee. Adrenaline slams me, and I am high inside myself, my throat raw, my skin vivid with electric fire. I am free. I can do anything. I am alive. In the chaos, nothing matters outside my body except to keep Nael and Tareq in sight. We hurtle forward, grabbing each other&#x2019;s hands to stay together, but the crowd&#x2019;s momentum is too much. Our hands part. My two friends are in front of me, behind me, beside me. I watch them out of the corners of my eyes.<br><br>Nael runs to the front of the crowd. He has wrapped his face in a kaffiyeh to protect against the tear gas and, probably, to conceal his identity; his honey-colored eyes sparkle like they want to escape their orbits. He reaches down to pick up garbage from the street. He hurls it toward the riot line. He screams something I cannot hear. Then he turns toward the crowd, jumps, and raises his hands in encouragement to attack. &#x201c;Hey hey! This is Raqqa!&#x201d; Are those his words? The crowd&#x2019;s? What does it matter? We are one. The riot line fires another volley of tear gas. Nael ducks.<br><br>We run down an alley. The neighborhood is a concrete mishmash of bare apartment boxes and traditional Arab houses, its streets barely the width of two cars. We flood them with our bodies, our lurching, screaming youth. The old woman is right. We are naughty children, bad but not ashamed. Fleet of foot, strong of lung and leg. Boys in jeans and undershirts&#x2014;our outer layers stripped off, then turned into improvised scarves that mask our faces. Five brave girls. Some protesters grab whatever their hands can find&#x2014;small rocks, bottles, trash&#x2014;and hurl it in the direction of our enemies. They syncopate their throws to the chants of the crazies at the front lines. &#x201c;Hey hey! This is Raqqa!&#x201d;<br><br>The military fires more canisters. We peel backwards, graceful as startled deer. The crowd clings to the walls, and I am left with Nael at the front lines. I silently repeat a Mark Twain quote I&#x2019;d memorized during university: &#x201c;Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear&#x2014;not absence of fear.&#x201d; <br><br>How long are we in the streets? It might be ten seconds or a night&#x2014;but it is enough. A few minutes are all we need. We curse the security forces who shake us down for bribes, lock up our families, rule our lives. They can kill us, but who cares?<br><br>We shout in their collective face.<br><br>We stare death in its eyes, and our minds are opened.<br><br>They have guns. We have nothing. In nothing, there lies power.<br><br>The young man beside me strips off his undershirt. The tear gas and sweat bead on his skinny brown chest. Come on, motherfucker, his body says. I&#x2019;m half-naked. You&#x2019;re in riot gear. I&#x2019;m stronger anyway. I can take you. Through my lens of tears, he ripples like a mirage.<br><br>The protest disperses. Nael drags us from corner store to corner store, trying to persuade the scared shopkeepers to sell us cola, which activists in other cities say is the best antidote for tear gas. When one finally agrees, we pour the sweet liquid greedily into each other&#x2019;s eyes. Along with the tear gas, the Coca-Cola washes away any lingering traces of shame.<br><br>I find my father and brother-in-law waiting for me in the sitting room. My yellow T-shirt is marked all over by Coke and tear gas and a small red stain I don&#x2019;t notice until later.<br><br>They know. Of course they know.<br><br>My brother-in-law starts blubbering, stuffing my ears with his cowardly remarks, but my father only offers a smile whose meaning I cannot read.<br><br>That night, as I lay my head on the pillow, frantic thoughts race through my mind. They&#x2019;re gonna get us. I&#x2019;ll be tortured to death. I&#x2019;m drained enough not to care. As I sink into sleep, I hear another, softer whisper: You&#x2019;ve become a man.<br><br>Two<br><br>Religious Exile<br><br>I was born in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Raqqa. My family&#x2019;s house was the material result of the years my father spent working outside the country as a trucker. He built its three rooms himself with money earned by hauling loads from the port of Aqaba, in Jordan, through Rutba&#x2014;a town the British built as a rest stop in the unfriendly deserts of Iraq&#x2019;s Anbar province&#x2014;and down the highway to Ramadi. The war between Iraq and Iran created chaos outside his windshield&#x2014;highway gangs and other criminal opportunists&#x2014;but he drove on anyway to deposit his cargo in Baghdad. His third truck accident left him buried in wreckage at the bottom of a Jordanian valley; he came back home with a broken spine. In the 1990s, after his recovery, he worked as a driver for one of the army&#x2019;s half-military, half-civil construction companies: Al-Eskan al-Askari, whose main business was taking decades-long contracts and making billions of Syrian pounds disappear. At Al-Eskan al-Askari&#x2019;s headquarters in Raqqa, my fasting father fought with his boss because my father refused to bring his boss&#x2019;s visitors lunch during Ramadan. Only a phone call from a well-connected friend saved him from being falsely reported as a Muslim Brotherhood member. He quit the job soon afterward and began growing vegetables in his backyard. My mother learned to sew traditional dresses from her mother-in-law. As a youngster, I apprenticed both professions. My four sisters and my brother and I slept in the same room and lived under my father&#x2019;s rigid routine of work, study, and prayer. TV, friends, play&#x2014;all banned. When other students talked about their adventures in amusement parks, I was silent. I nodded when they asked if I knew what had happened in the latest episode of the Viking cartoons&#x2014;though they soon discovered and mercilessly mocked my lies. If my father found out I&#x2019;d been beaten in school, he took his turn beating me when I got home. My father hadn&#x2019;t worked since the age of ten so his sons could turn into bullied, idle wastrels. He wanted better for us, even if this meant imprisoning us in our home.<br><br>Nael, whose family lived two blocks away from mine, had an even rougher childhood, though if its roughness was more a product of parental neglect than of parental domination. Nael&#x2019;s father worked for the water filtration station on the Euphrates and had married two wives. His wages weren&#x2019;t enough for both families and he fought with whichever wife he was with; his cries echoed so loudly that the whole neighborhood knew the intimate details of each of his nightly rants.<br><br>I met Nael in elementary school. Our long acquaintance has erased all memories of his child&#x2019;s face. I try to recall it now, but instead I see him as a miniature version of the man he was at twenty-four, all sharp cheekbones and messed-up hair and edgy, restless skinniness. He cracked jokes and sought mischief, even then&#x2014;he was smart as sin, filled with a confidence I did not have, born of a freedom for which I would have paid any price.<br><br>In accordance with the counsel of religious texts, my father was a regular napper, which provided me with chances to sneak over to Nael&#x2019;s after school. We played Monopoly and checkers, and on the rare occasions his black-and-white TV was not broken we watched Captain Majid, a dubbed Japanese cartoon&#x2014;the ultimate treat. During the shifts his father spent with his other wife, Nael and I played soccer with a stuffed plastic bag. In summer, he made a pool out of the pothole in the concrete in his backyard, and we slid into the shallow water. I measured the hours carefully, for if I came back home to find my father&#x2019;s nap shorter than expected, I would regret it, and so would Nael.<br><br>Children are fearless in finding their joy. Each Eid, when the adults were happy and busy with their interminable family visits, we leaped through this perfect window for our recalcitrance. One Eid, we went out to search for a movie theater, but finding those we knew closed or deserted, we instead drifted to the Rawdah Mosque to watch the noon prayers from the doorway. After the prayer ended, we watched as the worshipers closed the yellow curtains, then blocked any remaining light with prayer rugs. They had all sat down together in a big circle when a few of the worshipers saw us gawking from the doorway and one of them commanded us to join. We hesitantly entered the circle and sat down among them. Sacks filled with pebbles appeared, which the imam ordered distributed to the worshipers. He began to chant in the Naqshbandi Sufi fashion, each praise of God uttered to a haunting rhythm, echoed by the rest of us, who, with each repetition, passed a smooth pebble from our right hand to our left, then discarded it on the floor. I watched with fear as the used pebbles piled up, unsure of what would happen when the last pebble dropped. The men, their individuality now subsumed into the chant, rose at the imam&#x2019;s command and swayed in unison to the beat. The rhythm grew faster. The men began to jump and scream. From some unseen corner two zealots brought out swords. When they started to dance manically, my belly sank. My eyes sought Nael&#x2019;s. His face, dry with fright, was a perfect mirror of my own. We fled as stealthily as possible.</p><h2>Ethics Spinoza (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p>Written in a highly personal style, Spinoza&#39;s &#34;Ethics&#34; presents to readers anordered vision of the universe as a unified whole--not as a lifeless world ofinnumerable separate entities.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Baruch Spinoza (1632 &#x2013; 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Dutch philosopher. The breadth and importance of Spinoza's work was not fully realized until years after his death. By laying the groundwork for the 18th century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and, arguably, the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.</p><h2>Russia and the Russians: A History, Second Edition</h2><p>Hosking follows the country&#x2019;s history from the Slavs&#x2019; first emergence in the historical record in the sixth century C.E. to the Russians&#x2019; persistent appearances in today&#x2019;s headlines.

Poursuivant des etudes de medecine, il s'oriente vers la psychanalyse. En 1900, il devient assistant a l'hopital psychiatrique de Zurich. Presente a Freud en 1907, il est rapidement considere par ce dernier comme son successeur. Toutefois, les differences s'accumulent. Jung s'oppose effectivement a l'interpretation sexuelle du medecin viennois. Ainsi, la rupture se consomme en 1912. Jung entreprend ensuite de multiples voyages ethnographiques, au Kenya et en Inde notamment, qui lui permettent de mieux formaliser sa pensee. En 1921, il expose dans "Les types psychologiques" un inconscient defini par les pensees, les sensations, l'intuition et les sentiments et divise entre extraversion et introversion. Avec "L' energie psychique", il soumet l'hypothese de l'existence de deux formes d'inconscient, celui personnel et celui collectif, memoire de l'humanite vehiculant les grands archetypes mythologiques. Il devient le fondateur de la psychologie analytique. <br> <br>Born in 1875, C. G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and innovative thinker whose most influential ideas include the concept of psychological archetypes, the collective unconscious, and synchronicity. He is the author of numerous works, including Memories, Dreams, Reflections and Man and His Symbols. He died in 1961. <br> <br>Sir Herbert Edward Read, DSO, MC (1893-1968) was an English anarchist poet, and critic of literature and art. He was one of the earliest English writers to take notice of existentialism, and was strongly influenced by proto-existentialist thinker Max Stirner. <br> <br>Fordham was an international figure in the history of analysis.</p><h2>Midaq Alley</h2><p>Widely acclaimed as&nbsp;Naguib Mahfouz's best novel,&nbsp;<i>Midaq Alley</i> brings to life&nbsp;one of the hustling, teeming back alleys&nbsp;of Cairo&nbsp;in the 1940s. From Zaita the cripple-maker to Kirsha the hedonistic cafe owner,&nbsp;from Abbas the barber who mistakes greed for love to Hamida who sells her soul to escape the alley, from waiters and widows to politicians, pimps, and poets, the inhabitants of Midaq Alley&nbsp;vividly evoke Egypt's largest&nbsp;city as it teeters on the brink of change.

No other novel so vividly evokes the sights and sounds of the city. The universality and timelessness of this book cannot be denied.<p>Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. His nearly forty novels and hundreds of short stories range from re-imaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of <i>Palace Walk</i> (1956), <i>Palace of Desire</i> (1957), and <i>Sugar Street</i> (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in August 2006.</p></p><h2>Circuits and Systems: A Modern Approach (The Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering)</h2><p>Athanasios Papoulis' classic text was the first to present digital techniques as an integral part of a unified course in system theory and design, rather than as a separate unit. The enduring success of <em>Circuits and Systems</em> undoubtedly is due in large part to the author's concentration on fundamental ideas explained in the context of simple illustrations. The text develops analog systems parallel to digital systems, emphasizes the concepts of linearity, superposition, impulse response, frequency response, and system function. Laplace transforms and z-transforms are treated briefly, but completely, and the introduction to digital and sampled-analog simulation is based on the approximation of the convolution integral by a sum. The development of the material as a deductive discipline strengthens the student's analytical ability in the engineering course.</p><p></p><h2>Calculus with Applications</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:</b> This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Pedagogy of the Heart is filled with Freire's reminiscences of his early life and meditations "under my mango tree." These meditations include discussions of solitude and community, the limit of the Right, neoliberals and progressives, lessons from exile, the Lefts and the Right, dialogism, and faith and hope. Many of these subjects will be familiar to those who have read Freire before. For those coming to Freire for the first time, Pedagogy of the Heart will open new doors to the interrelations of education and political struggle.

The book demonstrates what sharply rising standards for literacy have meant to successive generations of Americans and how--as students, workers, parents, and citizens--they have responded to rapid changes in the meaning and methods of literacy learning in their society. Drawing on more than 80 life histories of Americans from all walks of life, the book addresses critical questions facing public education at the start of the twenty-first century.</p><p>Deborah Brandt is Professor Emerita of English at the University of Wisconsin, Madison."Literacy in American Lives is a meaningful contribution to the field of literacy and an important and necessary read for students of literacy history, researchers and theoreticians, leaders in the literary associations, and legislative policy makers." Journal of Literacy Research<br><br>"In Literacy in American Lives, Deborah Brandt raises the bar for the sound understanding of literacy at the end of the millennium. She does this by embedding her understanding--and ours--in an impressive blend of interdisciplinary approach and perspective; historical and cultural contextualization; and humane passion for her subject, the individual lives whose narratives undergird and mediate her interpretation, and all of our hopes and needs for the 21st century. Her treatment is fresh and original. Professors and educators across disciplines and institutions should read Literacy in American Lives. But its combination of sane argument and methodological rigor on a topic where commentators can succumb to excess calls out to readers beyond the academy." Harvey J. Graff, University of Texas at San Antonio<br><br>"This book makes a significant contribution to literacy studies, and it deserves to be widely read. Brandt pushes us to reconsider many settled assumptions about how people learn to read and write, and she does it in lyrical prose that is a pleasure to read. I expect that we will be talking about and following the lead of her work for a long time."

This novel tells of the series of events by which Okonkwo, through his pride and his fears, becomes exiled from the tribe.</p><p>One of the most widely read novels from Nigeria's most famous novelist. <b>Things Fall Apart</b> is a gripping study of the problem of European colonialism in Africa. The story relates the cultural collision that occurs when Christian English missionaries arrive among the Ibos of Nigeria, bringing along their European ways of life and religion. In the novel, the Nigerian Okonkwo recognizes the cultural imperialism of the white men and tries to show his own people how their own society will fall apart if they exchange their own cultural core for that of the English.This is Chinua Achebe&#39;s classic novel, with more than two million copies sold since its first U.S. publication in 1969.

Today, BSD is found in nearly every variant of UNIX, and is widely used for Internet services and firewalls, timesharing, and multiprocessing systems. Readers involved in technical and sales support can learn the capabilities and limitations of the system; applications developers can learn effectively and efficiently how to interface to the system; systems programmers can learn how to maintain, tune, and extend the system. Written from the unique perspective of the system's architects, this book delivers the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and authoritative technical information on the internal structure of the latest BSD system.</p> <p>As in the previous book on 4.3BSD (with Samuel Leffler), the authors first update the history and goals of the BSD system. Next they provide a coherent overview of its design and implementation. Then, while explaining key design decisions, they detail the concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing the system's facilities. As an in-depth study of a contemporary, portable operating system, or as a practical reference, readers will appreciate the wealth of insight and guidance contained in this book. </p><b>Highlights of the book:</b> <ul> <li>Details major changes in process and memory management </li><li>Describes the new extensible and stackable filesystem interface </li><li>Includes an invaluable chapter on the new network filesystem </li><li>Updates information on networking and interprocess communication </li></ul></p><p><p>This book is an extensive revision of the first authoritative and full-length description of the design and implementation of the research versions of the UNIX system developed at the University of California at Berkeley. Most detail is given about 4.4BSD, which incorporates the improvements of the previous Berkeley versions. Although 4.4BSD includes nearly 500 utility programs in addition to the kernel, this book concentrates almost exclusively on the kernel. </p><p>The UNIX System </p><p>The UNIX system runs on computers ranging from personal home systems to the largest supercomputers. It is the operating system of choice for most multiprocessor, graphics, and vector-processing systems, and is widely used for its original purpose of timesharing. It is the most common platform for providing network services (from FTP to WWW) on the Internet. It is the most portable operating system ever developed. This portability is due partly to its implementation language, C Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, 1978 (which is itself one of the most widely ported languages), and partly to the elegant design of the system. Many of the system's features are imitated in other systems O'Dell, 1987. </p><p>Since its inception in 1969 Ritchie &amp; Thompson, 1978, the UNIX system has developed in a number of divergent and rejoining streams. The original developers continued to advance the state of the art with their Ninth and Tenth Edition UNIX inside AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, and then their Plan 9 successor to UNIX. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T licensed UNIX System V as a product, before selling it to Novell. Novell passed the UNIX trademark to X/OPEN and sold the source code and distribution rights to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Both System V and Ninth Edition UNIX were strongly influenced by the Berkeley Software Distributions produced by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) of the University of California at Berkeley. </p><p>Berkeley Software Distributions </p><p>These Berkeley systems have introduced several useful programs and facilities to the UNIX community: 2BSD (the Berkeley PDP-11 system): the text editor vi 3BSD (the first Berkeley VAX system): demand-paged virtual-memory support 4.0BSD: performance improvements 4.1BSD: job control, autoconfiguration, and long C identifiers 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD: reliable signals; a fast filesystem; improved networking, including a reference implementation of TCP/IP; sophisticated interprocess-communication (IPC) primitives; and more performance improvements 4.4BSD: a new virtual memory system; a stackable and extensible vnode interface; a network filesystem (NFS); a log-structured filesystem, numerous filesystem types, including loopback, union, and uid/gid mapping layers; an ISO9660 filesystem (e.g., CD-ROM); ISO networking protocols; support for 68K, SPARC, MIPS, and PC architectures; POSIX support, including termios, sessions, and most utilities; multiple IP addresses per interface; disk labels; and improved booting </p><p>4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, and 4.4BSD are the bases for the UNIX systems of many vendors, and are used internally by the development groups of many other vendors. Many of these developments have also been incorporated by System V, or hav e been added by vendors whose products are otherwise based on System V. </p><p>The implementation of the TCP/IP networking protocol suite in 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD, and the availability of those systems, explain why the TCP/IP networking protocol suite is implemented so widely throughout the world. Numerous vendors have adapted the Berkeley networking implementations, whether their base system is 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.4BSD, System V, or even Digital Equipment Corporation's VMS or Microsoft's Winsock interface in Windows '95 and Windows/NT. </p><p>4BSD has also been a strong influence on the POSIX (IEEE Std 1003.1) operating-system interface standard, and on related standards. Several features--such as reliable signals, job control, multiple access groups per process, and the routines for directory operations--have been adapted from 4.3BSD for POSIX. </p><p>Material Covered in this Book </p><p>This book is about the internal structure of 4.4BSD Quarterman et al, 1985, and about the concepts, data structures, and algorithms used in implementing 4.4BSD's system facilities. Its level of detail is similar to that of Bach's book about UNIX System V Bach, 1986; however, this text focuses on the facilities, data structures, and algorithms used in the Berkeley variant of the UNIX operating system. The book covers 4.4BSD from the system-call level down--from the interface to the kernel to the hardware itself. The kernel includes system facilities, such as process management, virtual memory, the I/O system, filesystems, the socket IPC mechanism, and network protocol implementations. Material above the system-call level--such as libraries, shells, commands, programming languages, and other user interfaces--is excluded, except for some material related to the terminal interface and to system startup. Like Organick's book about Multics Organick, 1975, this book is an in-depth study of a contemporary operating system. </p><p>Where particular hardware is relevant, the book refers to the Hewlett-Packard HP300 (Motorola 68000-based) architecture. Because 4.4BSD was developed on the HP300, that is the architecture with the most complete support, so it provides a convenient point of reference. </p><p>Readers who will benefit from this book include operating-system implementors, system programmers, UNIX application developers, administrators, and curious users. The book can be read as a companion to the source code of the system, falling as it does between the manual CSRG, 1994 and the code in detail of treatment. But this book is specifically neither a UNIX programming manual nor a user tutorial (for a tutorial, see Libes &amp; Ressler, 1988). Familiarity with the use of some version of the UNIX system (see, for example, Kernighan &amp; Pike, 1984), and with the C programming language (see, for example, Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, 1988) would be extremely useful. </p><p>Use in Courses on Operating Systems </p><p>This book is suitable for use as a reference text to provide background for a primary textbook in a second-level course on operating systems. It is not intended for use as an introductory operating-system textbook; the reader should have already encountered terminology such as memory management, process scheduling, and I/O systems Silberschatz &amp; Galvin, 1994. Familiarity with the concepts of network protocols Tanenbaum, 1988; Stallings, 1993; Schwartz, 1987 will be useful for understanding some of the later chapters. </p><p>Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter. The exercises are graded into three categories indicated by zero, one, or two asterisks. The answers to exercises that carry no asterisks can be found in the text. Exercises with a single asterisk require a step of reasoning or intuition beyond a concept presented in the text. Exercises with two asterisks present major design projects or open research questions. </p><p>Organization </p><p>This text discusses both philosophical and design issues, as well as details of the actual implementation. Often, the discussion starts at the system-call level and descends into the kernel. Tables and figures are used to clarify data structures and control flow. Pseudocode similar to the C language is used to display algorithms. Boldface font identifies program names and filesystem pathnames. Italics font introduces terms that appear in the glossary and identifies the names of system calls, variables, routines, and structure names. Routine names (other than system calls) are further identified by the name followed by a pair of parenthesis (e.g., malloc() is the name of a routine, whereas argv is the name of a variable). </p><p>The book is divided into five parts, organized as follows: </p><p>Part 1, Overview </p><p>Three introductory chapters provide the context for the complete operating system and for the rest of the book. Chapter 1, History and Goals, sketches the historical development of the system, emphasizing the system's research orientation. Chapter 2, Design Overview of 4.4BSD, describes the services offered by the system, and outlines the internal organization of the kernel. It also discusses the design decisions that were made as the system was developed. Sections 2.3 through 2.14 in Chapter 2 give an overview of their corresponding chapter. Chapter 3, Kernel Services, explains how system calls are done, and describes in detail several of the basic services of the kernel. </p><p>Part 2, Processes </p><p>The first chapter in this part--Chapter 4, Process Management--lays the foundation for later chapters by describing the structure of a process, the algorithms used for scheduling the execution of processes, and the synchronization mechanisms used by the system to ensure consistent access to kernel-resident data structures. In Chapter 5, Memory Management, the virtual-memory!=management system is discussed in detail. </p><p>Part 3, I/O System </p><p>First, Chapter 6, I/O System Overview, explains the system interface to I/O and describes the structure of the facilities that support this interface.

S. Eliot wrote to Marianne Moore: "One of the books which obviously must in the fullness of time be published . . . will be the Letters of Marianne Moore."&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to fulfill his prediction. Marianne Moore's correspondence makes up the largest and most broadly significant collection of any modern poet. It documents the first two-thirds of this century, reflecting shifts from Victorian to modernist culture, the experience of the two world wars, the Depression and postwar prosperity, and the changing face of the arts in America and Europe. Moore wrote letters daily for most of her life--long, intense letters to friends and family; shorter, but always distinctive letters to an ever-widening circle of acquaintances and fans. At the height of her celebrity, she would occasionally write as many as fifty letters a day. Both Moore and her correspondents appreciated the value of their exchange, so that an extraordinary number of letters, approximately thirty thousand, have been preserved . . . It is Moore's poetry that draws us to her letters, of course. But in making this selection we have tried to present the life and mind of a woman whose interests extended to all the arts, to religion, politics, and psychology, to fashion, sports, and the domestic arts, moving freely between high culture and popular culture, and whose family and friendships remained as important as her professional life. Moore's correspondence is unique in the extent of its extraliterary interests and passionate engagement with the world at large. From her college adventures, her travels, and the flurry of her artistic and social activities, there seems to have been no lull. What has struck us most in reading through Moore's letters is the vitality and fullness of the long life they record.</p><p>To say that Marianne Moore was an extraordinary woman would be something of an understatement. Poet, editor, critic, and correspondent, Moore was also a friend to many of the greatest artists and writers of the 20th century, as well as an inveterate letter-writer--she sometimes wrote up to 50 letters a day. <i>The Selected Letters of Marianne Moore</i> offers only some of the poet's 30,000 surviving letters, but the ones editors Bonnie Costello, Celeste Goodridge, and Cristanne Miller have chosen are among the cr�me de la cr�me. Moore, who lived with her mother and never married, wrote often to her brother John, describing both the quotidian events of her life and her deepest insecurities about her writing. Other frequent recipients of Moore's letters included poets T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Elizabeth Bishop; singer Hildegarde Watson; and close friends Hilda Doolittle and Winifred Ellerman. Then there are the letters to E.E. Cummings, Allen Ginsberg, Edith Sitwell, and more, a veritable who's who of 20th-century arts and letters. <p> Marianne Moore's letters are fascinating on several accounts: first, there is the originality of her prose, which is invariably charming, witty, and expressive. Then there is the delightful <i>frisson</i> the reader experiences from eavesdropping on other people's private conversations--especially when those people are famous.

Written by an award winning teacher and scholar, the narrative highlights the major episodes of the European past and vividly connects those episodes to major international events. Each chapter opens with a compelling biographical sketch from Toussaint Louverture to Leni Riefenstahl that gives the book's ideas a vibrant, human face, while "Writing History" exercises at the end of each chapter offer students step by step guidance toward effective, polished prose. Taken together, the end of chapter exercises constitute a powerful expository writing program unique to this book.<br><br><em>Europe in the Modern World</em> pays considerably more attention to economic history than do other textbooks, demonstrating the role that economic developments and the political, social, and cultural responses to them play in shaping the political and social life of a given age. By taking politics and economics seriously while doing justice to social and cultural life, <em>Europe in the Modern World</em> explains the key phenomena of the Western past with clarity and verve. The book reads not like a typical academic text, but more like the best narrative history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edward Berenson</strong> is Professor of History at New York University, Director of NYU's Institute of French Studies, and a Senior Fellow at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. He is the author or editor of seven books and a recipient of the American Historical Association's Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award and UCLA's Distinguished Teaching Award.<br><br>"<em>Europe in the Modern World</em> is a Western Civilization textbook for the twenty-first century, breathing new life into a genre that has become stale and sometimes irrelevant. The book combines compelling storytelling, structure, and a means for teaching history and effective writing at the same time. I've never seen a textbook that does this in a quarter century of teaching history surveys at the university level."--Paul Lockhart, <em>Wright State University</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Berenson has pulled off an impressive feat in telling the story and explaining the significance of modern European history clearly, comprehensively, and concisely. Students will be drawn into each chapter by reading introductory vignettes about historical figures whose lives encapsulate the main themes of the period. Instructors and students alike will also find the self-directed writing exercises included at the end of each chapter to be an invaluable means of enhancing writing and thinking skills."--Geoffrey Clark, <em>The State University of New York at Potsdam</em> <br><p></p><br>"In the textbook market, there is a dearth of good, usable textbooks on European history from 1500 to the present. Edward Berenson has written one of the best--if not <em>the</em> best--textbook available today. It belongs on everyone's bookshelf, from freshmen in college to seasoned professors."--Ben Sorensen, <em>Cape Fear Community College</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Europe in the Modern World</em> is an innovative textbook that combines a compelling narrative with a rigorous step-by-step guide to historical writing. Its global framework is a much-needed alternative to traditional approaches to Western Civilization. Teachers and students will appreciate the effective integration of historical content and practical exercises."--Ute Chamberlin, <em>Western Illinois University</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Permaculture Book of Ferment &amp; Human Nutrition</h2><p>This is a guide to storing, preserving, and cooking foods using one of the oldest techniques known to man-that of fermentation.

These are dishes that feed the belly and speak the universal language of "mmm!"

It presents a new way to look at curriculum design and the learning that can result when we put students' funds of knowledge first. </p><p> <i>Classroom Diversity</i> takes a "sociocultural" approach to curriculum design, which provides minority and working-class students with the same privileges that middle-class students have always had: instruction that puts their knowledge and experiences at the heart of their learning. It presents both the theoretical framework for linking students' lives with curriculum and specific strategies from teachers who have done so successfully. Their stories show African American, Haitian American, Latino, Native American, and rural white students of Appalachian descent engaged in contextualized learning as they read and write and do mathematics and science across the grades. All of the classrooms described share one important characteristic: they use students' household-based funds of knowledge as resources for school-based funds of knowledge, building bridges in nontraditional ways.</p></p><p><p>Norma Gonzalez is an Associate Research Professor in the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology at the University of Arizona.

I experimented with many different teaching methods and had a good idea of what worked and what didn't. In retirement, I decided one day that I was going to learn Spanish. I used many different online resources and quickly made progress in understanding the basic grammar, but felt that my vocabulary was very limited. At that point, I discovered Paco Ardit's novels and everything changed. This author is a real genius. He understands what is important in language learning and his novels are constructed in a way that allows one to proceed effortlessly from one level to the next, but what sets him aside from all the rest is his talent as a writer. His novels are a delight to read. I started with the easiest ones (A1) and just finished _El robo del siglo_.His plots pull you in and you read and keep reading because you want to know what is going to happen next. You forget that you're engaged in a language-learning process. All you care about are the characters and the on-going action. _El robo del siglo_ was perhaps the most exciting novel I've read so far. I couldn't put it down and finished it in the early morning hours. But the biggest advantage of all is that the novels are so cleverly crafted that you don't have to resort to English at all to understand what's going on. You are totally immersed in Spanish and this is why your vocabulary increases at such a rapid pace. Now I want to go on to level C1 and beyond. As long as Paco Ardit is creating such fabulous material, I will always want to read his latest work."</i><br><b>- Charles Dockery</b></p><h2>Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People to Change Addictive Behavior</h2><p>Since the initial publication of this classic text, motivational interviewing (MI) has been used by countless clinicians in diverse settings.

Because of its strategic location on the Mediterranean, Venice had long imported objects from the Near East through channels of trade, and it flourished during this particular period as a commercial, political, and diplomatic hub. This monumental book examines Venice's rise as the "bazaar of Europe" and how and why the city absorbed artistic and cultural ideas that originated in the Islamic world.<br><br><i>Venice and the Islamic World, 828&#x2013;1797</i> features a wide range of fascinating images and objects, including paintings and drawings by familiar Venetian artists such as Bellini, Carpaccio, and Tiepolo; beautiful Persian and Ottoman miniatures; and inlaid metalwork, ceramics, lacquer ware, gilded and enameled glass, textiles, and carpets made in the Serene Republic and the Mamluk, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires. Together these exquisite objects illuminate the ways Islamic art inspired Venetian artists, while also highlighting Venice's own views toward its neighboring region. Fascinating essays by distinguished scholars and conservators offer new historical and technical insights into this unique artistic relationship between East and West.</p></p><p>Stefano Carboni is Curator and Administrator in the Department of Islamic Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><h2>Foundations of Education (What&#x2019;s New in Education)</h2><p>FOUNDATIONS OF EDUCATION, Eleventh Edition, helps students understand the key educational issues and policies affecting American education.

When we claim our place at the fire, we enter into the circle of vital elders who have been the source of wisdom in society since time immemorial. We do this by courageously reexamining and rediscovering who we are, where we belong, what we care about, and what our life's purpose is.<br> &#x2014;from the introduction<br><br> If you're in, or about to enter, "the second half of life, " this practical guide will show you how to claim your rightful place among the "new elders"&#x2014;men and women who &#x201c;use the second half of life as an empty canvas, a blank page, a hunk of clay to be crafted on purpose.&#x201d; Through inspiring stories and thought-provoking exercises, you'll learn to ask, and answer, four key questions:<br><br> <i>Who am I?</i> How do I stoke the wisdom gained in the first half of my life to burn more brightly in the second half?<br> <i>Where do I belong?</i> What makes a place the right place for me in the second half?<br> <i>What do I care about?</i> Where do I want to use my gifts and talents in the second half?<br> <i>What is my purpose?</i> How do I leave a legacy that has real meaning for myself and my loved ones?<br><br> This book provides a new model for vital aging. It shows you how to age successfully by living on purpose.<i><br> </i></p><p>Richard J. Leider is a founding partner of The Inventure Group, a coaching and consulting firm in Minneapolis.

We defined the good life as &#x201c;Living in the place you belong, with people you love, doing the right work, on purpose.&#x201d; While this definition applied to people who were in the first half of their lives, we&#x2019;ve found it to be no less pertinent to individuals who are entering into the second half.<br><br> In the second half of life, the same questions that drive our conception of the good life during the first half inevitably return. Who am I? Where do I belong? What do I care about? What is my life&#x2019;s purpose? Only now, in the second half, we have a unique opportunity to be the author of our own story. We have a chance to rewrite it, rather than simply replicate the first half.<br><br> It has become clear to us that becoming a new elder demands a rekindling of the good life. It requires drawing upon the wisdom we have gained in the first half.<br><br> 3<br><br> With the four components of the good life in mind, we have been able to identify four common principles among those seasoned citizens who are becoming new elders&#x2014;individuals who are living on purpose in the second half of their lives.<br><br> These principles have become apparent as we&#x2019;ve observed the indicators around us. Unfortunately, unlike the Hadza, we have no Honey Guide to guide us. We have had, however, the good fortune to witness dozens of new elders&#x2014; our own Honey Guides&#x2014;in action. Their choices, behaviors, and ways of moving through the world have enabled us to identify the &#x201c;four flames of vital aging&#x201d;&#x2014;the key components of a life lived on purpose during the second half.<br><br> These new elders have rekindled the good life for the second half. They have stoked the fire within and are sharing its warmth and light with others.<br><br> This fire metaphor does not arise by accident. It emerges naturally out of an ongoing exploration of what it means to be truly human. After all, nothing is more essential to the human experience than the experience of fire. Fire connects us to the deepest core of our shared humanity. Our most distant ancestors depended upon fire for their survival; our most distant descendents, like us, will employ fire in some form in order to live. The use of fire is quite literally what separates human beings from non-human beings. It is this understanding of the vital role that fire plays in our humanity that has given rise to the myths and stories of fire among indigenous peoples.<br><br> One of the most common ways that we talk about vitality is in terms of &#x201c;keeping the fire alive.&#x201d; For this reason&#x2014;as well as for the abiding role fire plays in linking past, present, and future&#x2014;the fire theme naturally emerges in our story of new elders. Each of the four key principles of new elders is embodied in a characteristic of fire. In claiming our place at the fire as new elders, we claim each of these aspects ourselves.<br><br> 4<br><br> 1. The Flame of Identity: Recalling Our Stories<br><br> Principle: Wisdom<br><br> Firestarter Question: Who Am I?<br><br> New elders harvest and transfer the wisdom of the past into the present. They know the important narratives of their culture, whatever that culture is. Joseph Campbell said, &#x201c;The first requirement of any society is that its adult membership should realize and represent the fact it is they who constitute its life and being . . . and on which that society itself must depend for its existence.&#x201d; Elders teach by story. But it isn&#x2019;t simply recalling stories about &#x201c;the good old days.&#x201d; Rather, it is an ability to touch the lives and lived experience of others through their own experiences in a manner that brings it alive in the present, through the past.<br><br> 2. The Flame of Community: Refinding Our Place<br><br> Principle: Intimacy<br><br> Firestarter Question: Where Do I Belong?<br><br> New elders know where they belong in the world; they have a powerful sense of place&#x2014;where they have come from, where they are, and where they are going.<br><br> Consequently, they are able to reaffirm who they are for the journey ahead; grounded in the rich history of their first half, they feel alive to the challenges of the second half.<br><br> 3. The Flame of Passion: Renewing Our Calling<br><br> 5<br><br> Principle: Caring Firestarter Question: What Do I Care About?<br><br> Perhaps no challenge is greater for people in the second half of life than to find something meaningful and valuable to do with their gifts. New elders consistently meet that challenge by applying their gifts in support of young people and the community at large. New elders care passionately about those who follow in their footsteps. They find deep satisfaction in giving their gifts in new ways that serve others rather than just themselves. And they accept this as a critical responsibility of their elderhood. Consequently, new elders are all about &#x201c;giving it away.&#x201d; They know that a person is strong not in proportion to what he or she can hold on to, but rather, according to what the person can give up. This doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean they are free-spending philanthropists when it comes to money; it does, however, usually mean they are extremely generous with advice, counsel, and support. While elders may hold important positions in life, they realize that real power stems from the willingness and ability to share it with others. They see wisdom as something that is inherent within everyone and, like the ancient philosopher Socrates, are passionate about helping to inspire that depth of wisdom within those around them.<br><br> 4. The Flame of Meaning: Reclaiming Our Purpose<br><br> 6<br><br> Principle: Meaning<br><br> Firestarter Question: What Is My Legacy?<br><br> New elders know &#x201c;why they get up in the morning,&#x201d; and it isn&#x2019;t just because their alarm clock goes off. As a matter of fact, for many new elders, the alarm that dragged them out of bed for so many years has been permanently retired. Freed up from imposed schedules, they now find the freedom to make their own. And with that freedom, they are enthusiastically greeting the day, fired up about all they can do at last. These new elders burn with the beacon that guides them: their purpose. They light the way for themselves and for others to follow. The incandescence of such elders is powerfully illuminating. As they forge ahead, lit by the fire of purpose, they light the way into the future.<br><br> The four flames of vital aging represent choices available to all of us. We can make those choices no matter what age or stage we are in life. And while they are no doubt choices that lend themselves more naturally to those of us in the second half of life, new elders are by no means the elderly. In fact, as we may realize, it is often aging, or the fear of it, that prevents many of us from ever really becoming elders.<br><br> Now, more than ever, we need new elders among us. New elders are natural resources that are needed today by the family, the community, the organization, and the Earth. We can&#x2019;t wait for the wise ones to come. We need to become the new elders. It is incumbent upon us to accept the mantle of becoming new elders for ourselves, our loved ones, and the planet as a whole.<br><br> Stepping into the Elder Circle<br><br> In his powerful account of age and aging, Ram Dass discusses an activity called an Elder Circle, which he does with people in the second half of life to help them appreciate their power and wisdom. Employing a form common to traditional cultures, he invites the oldest members of groups he brings together to sit in the inner circle and share their wisdom with the younger members, who sit around them in an outer circle. He reports that many of the elders who take part in this exercise say that it is the first time their wisdom has ever been appreciated. In Ram Dass&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;Because it does not know what to do with older people, our society has become impoverished of precisely those qualities its elders could offer. Unfortunately, most elders don&#x2019;t know, themselves, what it is they have to offer.&#x201d;<br><br> Our intention in this book is similar to what Ram Dass does in that exercise. We hope to provide you with a framework for coming to respect and appreciate your own power&#x2014; a power of purpose that grows with age.<br><br> To claim one&#x2019;s power as a new elder, a certain amount of reflection upon the past is necessary. The lessons learned in the first half of life must be revisited and reapplied to the second half. This book is structured to help you do that.<br><br> In the next chapter, The Flame of Identity: Recalling Our Stories, we explore the guidance that the power of narrative gives us as we wonder &#x201c;Who Am I?&#x201d; As we are becoming new elders, it is incumbent upon us to harvest the wisdom we have gained during the first half of life in order to sow its seeds for the second half. Recalling the stories that make us (and which have made us) who we are sets the context for connecting and reconnecting with friends, family, and community members. We are thus better positioned to expand upon and share our wisdom with others as new elders.<br><br> 8<br><br> Chapter 2, The Flame of Community: Refinding Our Place, addresses the question &#x201c;Where Do I Belong?&#x201d; Becoming a new elder offers us a unique opportunity for reexamining our place in the world. This chapter guides us by helping us to wonder what makes a place &#x201c;home&#x201d; and what we can do to create a sense of sacred space for the second half of life.<br><br> Chapter 3, The Flame of Passion: Renewing Our Calling, is a guide to the &#x201c;What Do I Care About?&#x201d; question. We investigate how, as new elders, we can continue to heed our calling in the next phase of life. As we move from full participation in the work world to the vocation of elderhood, we can use our gifts in new ways, through mentoring and other sorts of relationships that connect us to others through meaningful work.<br><br> Chapter 4: The Flame of Meaning: Reclaiming Our Purpose offers guidance for the biggest of the big questions, &#x201c;What Is My Legacy?&#x201d; It examines the power of purpose within the framework of the recognition that becoming a new elder is ultimately spiritual work. As we move into the second half of our lives, it becomes more and more clear that the time we spend here on Earth is only part of our overall story. Coming to terms with our spirituality and making friends with death as a teacher are some of the topics examined in this chapter as we find ways to keep the fire burning long after our own life&#x2019;s fire has burned low.<br><br> In the epilogue, Keeping the Fire Alive, we pull together the principles and stories of the previous chapters and formulate them into a manifesto for new elders in the twenty-first century. We provide a challenge for all persons in the second half of their lives to live on purpose and claim their place at the fire!<br><br> 9<br><br> What If This Dream Were True?<br><br> As we began work on this book, Dave had a dream that could only have been inspired by the discussions and content. He recalls:<br><br> The dream began with my death. I was in an airplane and it plummeted to Earth, killing all of us on board<br><br> I found myself in the afterlife, where I was given a unique opportunity. I was permitted to return alive to Earth for 24 hours, during which time I would be able to say my goodbyes to loved ones. I felt a great sense of urgency to communicate my feelings for my daughter and wife, especially. In the dream, I returned home where my daughter was doing her usual 6-year-old things&#x2014;being willful, testing boundaries, exploring life in ways that would typically make me want to steer clear or distract her with the TV or a video. Instead, I felt incredibly honored to be permitted to take part in her world. In the dream, I put my head right next to hers and absorbed the world from her perspective. I wanted nothing more than to just &#x201c;be there&#x201d; with her as she was being.<br><br> Similarly, in the dream, I was frantic to spend my allotted 24 hours rekindling the passion in my relationship with my wife. I wanted to set aside all the day-to-day negotiations and compromise that go along with making a marriage work and just get back to the essence of what initially drew us together. Again, in the dream, I remember thinking how vital it was that I just experience my wife, Jennifer, as a person, without trying to impose my expectations or wishes upon her. I just wanted to drink as deeply as I could of her in the time I had left.<br><br> 10<br><br> When I awoke, I was terribly relieved that it was all just a dream and that I wasn&#x2019;t already dead. But all that day, I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking that, in a way, the dream captured what life is or could be all about. What if, I wondered, I tried to keep in mind what a great gift this life is and how critical it is that I use all the time I have to let those I love know that I love them&#x2014;not for whom I expect them to be, but for whom they are.<br><br> As we move into the second half of our lives, suppose we were to wonder if Dave&#x2019;s dream was, in essence, true? It&#x2019;s certainly a possibility explored throughout history in many works from great literature to popular culture. Think of Dante&#x2019;s journey through heaven and hell as he strayed from the right path, midway upon the journey of life in The Divine Comedy. Or of George Bailey&#x2019;s chance to see what the world would be like if he&#x2019;d never been born in It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life.<br><br> Getting a second chance in the second half of life is a desire that tugs at us from the deepest levels. Having an opportunity to rewrite the second chapter by drawing upon what we&#x2019;ve learned during the first is a dream we all share.<br><br> As we approach our fourth decade, we begin to think a lot about who we are and where we&#x2019;re going. We begin listening to the still, small voice gently whispering &#x201c;what is my truest purpose?&#x201d; The &#x201c;second half&#x201d; begins at that time in most of our lives&#x2014;usually between the ages of 35 and 55&#x2014;when we begin to realize we aren&#x2019;t going to live forever. We begin to seriously value our most precious currency, our remaining time. This universal, sometimes unspoken, realization ignites the desire to live on purpose in the second half.<br><br> 11<br><br> At the same time, pondering this serves to remind us that what we mean by the &#x201c;second half of life&#x201d; is something of a moving target. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that, in 2001, the average life expectancy for men and women in the United States is about 77 years. So, statistically, most of us enter into the second half when we&#x2019;re about 38 and a half. Our 40th birthdays, of course, are more of a watershed point when we&#x2019;re apt to admit that we&#x2019;re finally entering &#x201c;middle age.&#x201d; But that&#x2019;s changing, too. These days, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, people turning 50 can expect to live another 30 to 32 years on average. That&#x2019;s up more than a decade from the start of the twentieth century. And with advances in health care and medical technology, who knows how long the second half will be for any us?<br><br> Ironically, though, even as the years before us promise to stretch longer, the time remaining becomes more precious. While the perspective gained in the first half of life typically leads to a certain sense of calm in the second half, it also tends to bring with it a heightened sense of urgency.<br><br> What if, we may begin to ask ourselves, we do have only a short time left to live? What if, as in Dave&#x2019;s dream, we have but a limited time to finish the unfinished business of our lives? In what ways would we act differently? In what ways would our best and truest purpose show itself in ways that it doesn&#x2019;t now? What would we say that we haven&#x2019;...</p><h2>Aaron Copland: The Life &amp; Work of an Uncommon Man</h2><p>A candid and fascinating portrait of the American composer. <br><br>The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Aaron Copland (1900-1990) became one of America's most beloved and esteemed composers. His work, which includes Fanfare for the Common Man, A Lincoln Portrait, and Appalachian Spring, has been honored by a huge following of devoted listeners. But the full richness of Copland's life and accomplishments has never, until now, been documented or understood. Howard Pollack's meticulously researched and engrossing biography explores the symphony of Copland's life: his childhood in Brooklyn; his homosexuality; Paris in the early 1920s; the Alfred Stieglitz circle; his experimentation with jazz; the communist witch trials; Hollywood in the forties; public disappointment with his later, intellectual work; and his struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, Pollack presents informed discussions of Copland's music, explaining and clarifying its newness and originality, its aesthetic and social aspects, its distinctive and enduring personality.<br></p><p>Opening with a 12-page chapter that gives a sharper impression of the great American composer's personality than many full-length books, this superb biography goes from strength to strength as it elucidates Aaron Copland's background, beliefs, affiliations, and achievements. Music historian Howard Pollack depicts Copland (1900-90) as a man whose inner serenity and self-confidence enabled him to encompass "startling dichotomies" in his life and work. "A participant in the avant-garde, he wrote works of popular appeal," comments the author. "A Jewish, homosexual, liberal New Yorker, he became a national hero." Moving forward in a generally chronological manner, the narrative mixes two kinds of chapters. Some pursue themes over time: his feelings about European music (he adored Stravinsky, was ambivalent about Mozart), his political commitments (which got him into trouble during the McCarthy era), and his relationships with fellow composers and a host of nonmusical artists all equally determined to give America its own distinctive culture. Others concentrate on describing and analyzing groups of compositions: perennial favorites like <i>Appalachian Spring</i> and <i>Billy the Kid</i>, of course, but also the concertos and symphonies respected by his peers. In either mode, Pollack writes with a clarity and dignity eminently suitable to his subject, who seems as warmly appealing as his music. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>One of America's most beloved and accomplished composers, Aaron Copland played a crucial role in the coming of age of American music. This substantial biography is the first full-length scholarly study of his life and work.<p>A conductor, music critic, and teacher who wrote clearly and accessibly about music, Copland composed some of the twentieth century's most familiar works -- Billy the Kid, Rodeo, Appalachian Spring, Fanfare for the Common Man -- in addition to a wealth of music for opera, ballet, chorus, orchestra, chamber ensemble, band, radio, and film. Howard Pollack's expansive and detailed biography examines Copland's musical development, his political sympathies, his personal life, and his tireless encouragement of younger composers, presenting a balanced and skillfully wrought portrait of an American original.</p></p><h2>PTL: The Rise and Fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker&#39;s Evangelical Empire</h2><p>In 1974 Jim and Tammy Bakker launched their television show, the<em> PTL Club</em>, from a former furniture store in Charlotte, N.C. with half a dozen friends. By 1987 they stood at the center of a ministry empire that included their own satellite network, a 2300-acre theme park visited by six million people a year, and millions of adoring fans. The Bakkers led a life of conspicuous consumption perfectly aligned with the prosperity gospel they preached. They bought vacation homes, traveled first-class with an entourage and proclaimed that God wanted everyone to be healthy and wealthy. <br><br>When it all fell apart, after revelations of a sex scandal and massive financial mismanagement, all of America watched more than two years of federal investigation and trial as Jim was eventually convicted on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He would go on to serve five years in federal prison. <br><br><em>PTL</em> is more than just the spectacular story of the rise and fall of the Bakkers, John Wigger traces their lives from humble beginnings to wealth, fame, and eventual disgrace. At its core, PTL is the story of a group of people committed to religious innovation, who pushed the boundaries of evangelical religion's engagement with American culture. <br><br>Drawing on trial transcripts, videotapes, newspaper articles, and interviews with key insiders, dissidents, and lawyers, Wigger reveals the power of religion to redirect American culture. This is the story of a grand vision gone wrong, of the power of big religion in American life and its limits.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Wigger </strong>is Professor of History at the University of Missouri. His research focuses on American religious and cultural history. He is the author of <em>American Saint</em> (OUP 2009) and <em>Taking Heaven by Storm</em> (OUP 1998).<br><br>"Wigger explicates critically but fairly the story of Jim Bakker and PTL ('Praise the Lord' or 'People That Love') Recommended."--W.B. Bedford, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Taking on scandal as a subject of study is complicated. It is tempting to dismiss PTL and the Bakkers as the worst exemplars of Christian hypocrisy. The more productive venture is to explicate the complexity of the Bakkers' motivations, to explain the gradual escalation of their ambition, and to narrate the story of grace found and lost. Wigger does this admirably and with good humor. Several passages stand out as delightfully funny-a rare feature in historical writing. As Jim Bakker continues to sell his apocalyptic gruel by exploiting Americans' fears, understanding the culture that he helped create and in which he still operates has never been more important."--Suzanna Krivulskaya, <em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"Thorough and thoughtful, Wigger's book affords nuance to a story that has often otherwise been relegated to tabloid fodder. PTL is a fascinating study of the ignominious collapse of an evangelical empire-an event that captured and scandalized a nation." - Foreword Reviews <br><p></p><br>"Wigger succeeds in providing a three-dimensional view of the one-dimensional figures of American television and a greater understanding of the Bakkers and their followers." - Library Journal <br><p></p><br>"Captivating...outstanding...Anyone interested in the theological underpinnings of certain contemporary strains of right-wing American politics, as well as those more particularly interested in the Bakkers or televangelism, should find this book rewarding." - Publishers Weekly, starred review <br><p></p><br>"RivetingELEngaging storylines and a wild cast of characters keep the pages turningELIt is perhaps fitting that this definitive history of the Bakkers and PTL is at once edifying and entertaining-a tribute, in that sense, to what might have been." - Christianity Today <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship</h2><p>A startling amalgam of Zulu war-cry and Sherlock Holmes, of practical tips on health and hygiene and object lessons in woodcraft, Scouting for Boys (1908) is the original blueprint and inspiration for the Boy Scout Movement. An all-time bestseller in the English-speaking world, second in its heyday only to the Bible, it is one of the most influential manuals for youth ever published, known and loved around the world. Including all of Baden-Powell&#39;s original illustrations, this new critical edition of Scouting for Boys serves up a wonderful hodge-podge of true crime stories, stern moralizing, stock adventure tales, natural history, first-aid tips, advice on observation and tracking, and much more. Readers will find a roughly composed pastiche of jingoist lore and tracker legend, padded with lengthy quotations from adventure fiction-from Rudyard Kipling and James Fenimore Cooper, to Alexander Dumas and Arthur Conan Doyle-and seamed through with the multiple anxieties of its time: fears of degeneration (&#34;the fall of the Roman empire was due to bad citizenship&#34;) and a constant worry over imminent war. Alongside practical instructions on how to light fires, build a boat, or stalk animals (or men), it includes sections on chivalry, self-discipline, self-improvement, and citizenship. Indeed, the book brims with Baden-Powell&#39;s philosophy of life, one that replaces self with service, puts country before the individual, and duty above all. The introduction by Elleke Boehmer illuminates the book&#39;s maverick complexity and her notes clarify obscure references. Though almost a century old, Scouting for Boys continues to fascinate, surprise, and motivate readers today. It will delight anyone interested in popular culture, Victorian history, and literature for children.</p><p><br><strong>Elleke Boehmer</strong> is Hildred Carlile Professor in English at Royal Holloway, University of London.

She has also written short stories and three novels, most recently <em>Bloodlines</em>.<br><br>"Edited, annotated and introduced by Elleke Boehmer, professor of colonial and post-colonial literature at Nottingham Trent University in England, this fascinating volume tells us alot about Baden-Powell, his movements and even to some extent the particular point in time when scouting was born"--<em>Washington Times</em> "<em>Scouting for Boys</em> was written in the spirit of Peter Pan and Kipling's <em>Kim</em>; the games and plays and campfire stories are full of good ideas and good fun. The chapters on tracking, woodcraft, camp life and chivalry are full of simple (sometimes lifesaving) bits of practical information and exercises that teach children how to be observant, courteous and innovative."--<em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Ford Ranger Pick-ups, 1993-2010 (Haynes Repair Manual)</h2><p>Inside this manual you will find routine maintenance, tune-up procedures, engine repair, cooling and heating, air conditioning, fuel and exhaust, emissions control, ignition, brakes, suspension and steering, electrical systems, and wiring diagrams.</p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Written for students beginning a serious study of literature, the text introduces the fundamental elements of fiction, poetry, and drama in a concise and engaging way, addressing vital questions that other texts tend to ignore, such as &#34;Is some literature better?&#34; and &#34;How can it be evaluated?&#34; A remarkable selection of classic, modern, and contemporary readings serves to illustrate the elements of literature and ensure broad appeal to students of diverse backgrounds and interests. Now thoroughly updated with nearly 80 new stories, poems, and plays by some of the finest authors of any era, the eleventh edition remains true to Perrine&#39;s original vision while addressing the needs of a new generation of students.</p><p>Thomas R.

By solving challenges that encourage kids to &#34;group&#34; numbers rather than memorize formulas, even the most reluctant math learners are inspired to see math in a whole new way! Math Potatoes is full of Tang and Briggs&#39; trademark humor, wit, and extraordinary creativity. Tang has proven over and over that math can be fun, and this new addition to his acclaimed series of mind-stretching math riddles is sure to be another hit.</p><p>Grade 3-6&#x2013;Tang's seventh entry in a series that includes <i>The Grapes of Math</i> (2001) and <i>Math-terpieces</i> (2003, both Scholastic) is another winner. Each spread includes a poem consisting of neatly rhymed couplets that first set a scene (I gaze into the evening sky,/Think great thoughts and wonder why) and concludes with a hint or suggestion as to how the objects on the opposing page might most efficiently be grouped to arrive at a sum (When you look up to the heavens,/Try to think in groups of sevens!). There are no overt patterns so that, as Tang says in his author's note, children are challenged to combine numbers in smart ways, not just obvious ways. The book concludes with clear diagrams and succinct explanations providing the solutions. Briggs's computer-generated art is crisp, clear, and delightfully quirky. For example, Sock Hop features a loafer on guitar, work boots on drums, and a high-heeled pump on keyboard. Puzzle-loving kids will pick this up on their own, and teachers could pair it with Jon Scieszka's <i>Math Curse</i> (Viking, 1995) for an energizing departure from the standard math lesson.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The seventh in Tang's math series, which includes <i>The Grapes of Math </i>(2000), this picture book uses all kinds of visual tricks to demonstrate how to make arithmetic faster and easier. On each double-page spread, a rhyming verse has fun with a variety of subjects. Most rhymes are about foods--including pickles, potatoes, and "flat-jacks"--and the bright, computer-generated pictures are as playful as the words. This goes far beyond the usual simple counting book. The games are complex, the visuals are tricky, and although the rhyme seems straightforward ("Instead of adding row by row / Columns are the way to go"), readers must think carefully about adding, subtracting, and multiplying. "Imagine eight in every row / Just subtract and you will know." The spacious, illustrated answer pages at the back explain the puzzles, which will be fun for classroom use as well as for kids trying to find shortcuts in the counting jungle. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century.

Over his head was a bull's head, stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls were framed photographs and bull-fight posters.</p> <p>The little man sat looking at Manuel.</p> <p>"I thought they'd killed you," he said.</p> <p>Manuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk. The little man sat looking at him across the desk.</p> <p>"How many corridas you had this year?" Retana asked.</p> <p>"One," he answered.</p> <p>"Just that one?" the little man asked.</p> <p>"That's all."</p> <p>"I read about it in the papers," Retana said. He leaned back in the chair and looked at Manuel.</p> <p>Manuel looked up at the stuffed bull. He had seen it often before. He felt a certain family interest in it. It had killed his brother, the promising one, about nine years ago. Manuel remembered the day. There was a brass plate on the oak shield the bull's head was mounted on. Manuel could not read it, but he imagined it was in memory of his brother. Well, he had been a good kid.</p> <p>The plate said: "The Bull ?Mariposa' of the Duke of Veragua, which accepted 9 varas for 7 caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia, Novillero, April 27, 1909."</p> <p>Retana saw him looking at the stuffed bull's head.</p> <p>"The lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will make a scandal," he said. "They're all bad in the legs. What do they say about them at the Caf�?"</p> <p>"I don't know," Manuel said. "I just got in."</p> <p>"Yes," Retana said. "You still have your bag."</p> <p>He looked at Manuel, leaning back behind the big desk.</p> <p>"Sit down," he said. "Take off your cap."</p> <p>Manuel sat down; his cap off, his face was changed. He looked pale, and his coleta pinned forward on his head, so that it would not show under the cap, gave him a strange look.</p> <p>"You don't look well," Retana said.</p> <p>"I just got out of the hospital," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I heard they'd cut your leg off," Retana said.</p> <p>"No," said Manuel. "It got all right."</p> <p>Retana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of cigarettes toward Manuel.</p> <p>"Have a cigarette," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>Manuel lit it.</p> <p>"Smoke?" he said, offering the match to Retana.</p> <p>"No," Retana waved his hand, "I never smoke."</p> <p>Retana watched him smoking.</p> <p>"Why don't you get a job and go to work?" he said.</p> <p>"I don't want to work," Manuel said. "I am a bull-fighter."</p> <p>"There aren't any bull-fighters any more," Retana said.</p> <p>"I'm a bull-fighter," Manuel said.</p> <p>"Yes, while you're in there," Retana said.</p> <p>Manuel laughed.</p> <p>Retana sat, saying nothing and looking at Manuel.</p> <p>"I'll put you in a nocturnal if you want," Retana offered.</p> <p>"When?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"Tomorrow night."</p> <p>"I don't like to substitute for anybody," Manuel said. That was the way they all got killed. That was the way Salvador got killed. He tapped with his knuckles on the table.</p> <p>"It's all I've got," Retana said.</p> <p>"Why don't you put me on next week?" Manuel suggested.</p> <p>"You wouldn't draw," Retana said. "All they want is Litri and Rubito and La Torre. Those kids are good."</p> <p>"They'd come to see me get it," Manuel said, hopefully.</p> <p>"No, they wouldn't. They don't know who you are any more."</p> <p>"I've got a lot of stuff," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I'm offering to put you on tomorrow night," Retana said. "You can work with young Hernandez and kill two novillos after the Charlots."</p> <p>"Whose novillos?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. Whatever stuff they've got in the corrals. What the veterinaries won't pass in the daytime."</p> <p>"I don't like to substitute," Manuel said.</p> <p>"You can take it or leave it," Retana said. He leaned forward over the papers. He was no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel had made to him for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone. He would like to get him to substitute for Larita because he could get him cheaply. He could get others cheaply too. He would like to help him though. Still he had given him the chance. It was up to him.</p> <p>"How much do I get?" Manuel asked. He was still playing with the idea of refusing. But he knew he could not refuse.</p> <p>"Two hundred and fifty pesetas," Retana said. He had thought of five hundred, but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty.</p> <p>"You pay Villalta seven thousand," Manuel said.</p> <p>"You're not Villalta," Retana said.</p> <p>"I know it," Manuel said.</p> <p>"He draws it, Manolo," Retana said in explanation.</p> <p>"Sure," said Manuel. He stood up. "Give me three hundred, Retana."</p> <p>"All right," Retana agreed. He reached in the drawer for a paper.</p> <p>"Can I have fifty now?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"Sure," said Retana. He took a fifty-peseta note out of his pocket-book and laid it, spread out flat, on the table.</p> <p>Manuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.</p> <p>"What about a cuadrilla?" he asked.</p> <p>"There's the boys that always work for me nights," Retana said. "They're all right."</p> <p>"How about picadors?" Manuel asked.</p> <p>"They're not much," Retana admitted.</p> <p>"I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.</p> <p>"Get him then," Retana said. "Go and get him."</p> <p>"Not out of this," Manuel said. "I'm not paying for any cuadrilla out of sixty duros."</p> <p>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel across the big desk.</p> <p>"You know I've got to have one good pic," Manuel said.</p> <p>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel from a long way off.</p> <p>"It isn't right," Manuel said.</p> <p>Retana was still considering him, leaning back in his chair, considering him from a long way away.</p> <p>"There're the regular pics," he offered.</p> <p>"I know," Manuel said. "I know your regular pics."</p> <p>Retana did not smile. Manuel knew it was over.</p> <p>"All I want is an even break," Manuel said reasoningly. "When I go out there I want to be able to call my shots on the bull. It only takes one good picador."</p> <p>He was talking to a man who was no longer listening.</p> <p>"If you want something extra," Retana said, "go and get it. There will be a regular cuadrilla out there. Bring as many of your own pics as you want. The charlotada is over by 10.30."</p> <p>"All right," Manuel said. "If that's the way you feel about it."</p> <p>"That's the way," Retana said.</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow night," Manuel said.</p> <p>"I'll be out there," Retana said.</p> <p>Manuel picked up his suitcase and went out.</p> <p>"Shut the door," Retana called.</p> <p>Manuel looked back. Retana was sitting forward looking at some papers. Manuel pulled the door tight until it clicked.</p> <p>He went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of the street. It was very hot in the street and the light on the white buildings was sudden and hard on his eyes. He walked down the shady side of the steep street toward the Puerta del Sol. The shade felt solid and cool as running water. The heat came suddenly as he crossed the intersecting streets. Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he passed.</p> <p>Just before the Puerta del Sol he turned into a caf�.</p> <p>It was quiet in the caf�. There were a few men sitting at tables against the wall. At one table four men played cards. Most of the men sat against the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups and liqueur-glasses before them on the tables. Manuel went through the long room to a small room in back. A man sat at a table in the corner asleep. Manuel sat down at one of the tables.</p> <p>A waiter came in and stood beside Manuel's table.</p> <p>"Have you seen Zurito?" Manuel asked him.</p> <p>"He was in before lunch," the waiter answered. "He won't be back before five o'clock."</p> <p>"Bring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary," Manuel said.</p> <p>The waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big coffee-glass and a liqueur-glass on it. In his left hand he held a bottle of brandy. He swung these down to the table and a boy who had followed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny, spouted pots with long handles.</p> <p>Manuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned forward on his head. He winked at the coffee-boy </p> <p>as he poured out the brandy into the little glass beside Manuel's coffee. The coffee-boy looked at Manuel's pale face curiously.</p> <p>"You fighting here?" asked the waiter, corking up the bottle.</p> <p>"Yes," Manuel said. "Tomorrow."</p> <p>The waiter stood there, holding the bottle on one hip.</p> <p>"You in the Charlie Chaplins?" he asked.</p> <p>The coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.</p> <p>"No. In the ordinary."</p> <p>"I thought they were going to have Chaves and Hernandez," the waiter said.</p> <p>"No. Me and another."</p> <p>"Who? Chaves or Hernandez?"</p> <p>"Hernandez, I think."</p> <p>"What's the matter with Chaves?"</p> <p>"He got hurt."</p> <p>"Where did you hear that?"</p> <p>"Retana."</p> <p>"Hey, Looie," the waiter called to the next room, "Chaves got cogida."</p> <p>Manuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them into his coffee. He stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and warming in his empty stomach. He drank off the brandy.</p> <p>"Give me another shot of that," he said to the waiter.</p> <p>The waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full, slopping another drink into the saucer. Another waiter had come up in front of the table. The coffee-boy was gone.</p> <p>"Is Chaves hurt bad?" the second waiter asked Manuel.</p> <p>"I don't know," Manuel said, "Retana didn't say."</p> <p>"A hell of a lot he cares," the tall waiter said. Manuel had not seen him before. He must have just come up.</p> <p>"If you stand in with Retana in this town, you're a made man," the tall waiter said. "If you aren't in with him, you might just as well go out and shoot yourself."</p> <p>"You said it," the other waiter who had come in said. "You said it then."</p> <p>"You're right I said it," said the tall waiter. "I know what I'm talking about when I talk about that ...</p></p><h2>Aristophanes, V, Fragments (Loeb Classical Library No. 502)</h2><p><p>The eleven plays by Aristophanes that have come down to us intact brilliantly illuminate the eventful period spanned by his forty-year career, beginning with the first production in 427 BCE. But the Athenians knew much more of his work: over forty plays by Aristophanes were read in antiquity, of which nearly a thousand fragments survive. These provide a fuller picture of the poet's ever astonishing comic vitality and a wealth of information and insights about his world. Jeffrey Henderson's new, widely acclaimed Loeb edition of Aristophanes is completed by this volume containing what survives from, and about, his lost plays, hitherto inaccessible to the nonspecialist, and incorporating the enormous scholarly advances that have been achieved in recent years. </p><p>Each fragmentary play is prefaced by a summary of what can be inferred about its plot, characters, themes, theatricality, and topical significance. Also included in this edition are the ancient reports about Aristophanes' life, works, and influence on the later comic tradition.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Henderson is William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University.

Crafted with that adage in mind, <i>The Dramatic Writer&#x2019;s Companion</i> is designed to help writers explore their own ideas in order to develop the script in front of them. No ordinary guide to plotting, this handbook starts with the principle that character is key. &#x201c;The character is not something added to the scene or to the story,&#x201d; writes author Will Dunne. &#x201c;Rather, the character <i>is</i> the scene. The character <i>is</i> the story.&#x201d;</p><p>Having spent decades working with dramatists to refine and expand their existing plays and screenplays, Dunne effortlessly blends condensed dramatic theory with specific action steps&#x2014;over sixty workshop-tested exercises that can be adapted to virtually any individual writing process and dramatic script. Dunne&#x2019;s in-depth method is both instinctual and intellectual, allowing writers to discover new actions for their characters and new directions for their stories.</p><p>Dunne&#x2019;s own experience is a crucial element of this guide. His plays have been selected by the Eugene O&#x2019;Neill Theatre Center for three U.S. National Playwrights Conferences and have earned&nbsp;numerous honors,&nbsp;including a Charles MacArthur Fellowship, four Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle Awards, and two Drama-Logue Playwriting Awards. Thousands of individuals have already benefited from his workshops, and <i>The Dramatic Writer&#x2019;s Companion</i> promises to bring his remarkable creative method to an even wider audience.</p></p><p><b></b><p><b>Will Dunne</b> is currently a resident playwright at Chicago Dramatists, where he develops plays and teaches workshops. He also has led over fifteen hundred workshops through his San Francisco program, served as a dramaturg at the O&#x2019;Neill, and twice attended the Australian National Playwrights Conference as guest instructor. His plays, which include <i>How I Became an Interesting Person</i> and <i>Hotel Desperado</i>, have been presented in Russia, Australia, and Croatia as well as in the U.S.</p>&#x201c;Dunne has taken everything he knows from the powerful dual standpoints of an award-winning playwright and a master teacher to create the book we&#x2019;ve been waiting for. It&#x2019;s all there&#x2014;from every angle and every perspective&#x2014;how to bring fascinating, fully-developed characters in conflict out into the light and onto the stage.&#x201d;<br><br> (Susan Stauter, artistic director, San Francisco Unified School District)<br><br>&#x201c;Dunne mixes an artist&#x2019;s imagination and intuition with a teacher&#x2019;s knowledge of the craft of dramatic writing. It is an irresistible combination, producing a book which is simultaneously astute <i>and</i> imaginative. . . . No one can teach anyone to become a dramatic writer. But it is possible to learn how to improve your writing skills. It is possible to be provoked into thinking differently, into adding different colours and dimensions to your ideas, to extend the range of images in your head, to startle your imagination; in short, to be inspired into trying new approaches and methods. <i>The Dramatic Writer&#x2019;s Companion</i> has the potential to do all of that for a writer.&#x201d;<br><br> (May-Brit Akerholt, award-winning dramaturg)<br><br>&#x201c;A breath of fresh air.

Yet by 1936 legislation designed to liberate women from their legal and economic dependence had given way to increasingly conservative solutions aimed at strengthening traditional family ties and women&#39;s reproductive role. This book explains the reversal, focusing on how women, peasants, and orphans responded to Bolshevik attempts to remake the family, and how their opinions and experiences in turn were used by the state to meet its own needs.</p><p>Focusing on how women, peasants and orphans responded to Bolshevk attempts to remake the family, this text reveals how, by 1936, legislation designed to liberate women had given way to increasingly conservative solutions strengthening traditional family values."...a valuable investigation of issues central to the Soviet regime's claim for seven decades of liberating women and fostering freer, more equal relations between the sexes....The book should be read by all serious students of the Soviet period."

Described as America&#x2019;s Amazon, Alabama has more species per square mile than any other state. Its rivers are home to more species of fish, crayfish, salamanders, mussels, snails and turtles than any other aquatic system in North America. And the contest isn&#x2019;t even close. California, for instance, has nine species of crayfish, while Alabama has 84. The 11 states that are drained by the Colorado River system are collectively home to 26 species of fish, while Alabama is home to 350 species of fish.<br> <br>But the wild places of the state are also under siege. Alabama has suffered more aquatic extinctions than any other state. In fact, more than half of all extinctions in the United States since the 1800s happened in Alabama, which has been logged, mined, and poisoned by a succession of industries. In this compelling portrait of the rough history of Alabama&#x2019;s rivers and the lands they flow through, Raines makes a case that more has been lost in Alabama than any other state thanks to the destructive hand of man. The version of Alabama that exists in the mind of the public &#x2013; lynchings and fire hoses, cotton fields and steel mills &#x2013; comes from things we&#x2019;ve done to Alabama, and has for too long overshadowed the stunning natural splendor of the place.<br> <br>Saving America&#x2019;s Amazon highlights this other Alabama, a wild place of incredible diversity, of ancient gardens and modern edens. The ascendant view among scientists today is that Alabama&#x2019;s wild places should be treasured and protected as one of the richest and most diverse regions on the globe, an internationally important &#x201c;biodiversity hotspot.&#x201d; But that is not what is happening on the ground in Alabama, which spends less on environmental protection than any other state. Instead, the constant stream of newly discovered species struggles to keep pace with the number of creatures being declared forever lost. The time of reckoning is here for the people of Alabama, who must decide whether their state will wear the crown for being the most diverse place on the continent, or the crown for the place with the most extinctions. One thing is certain, Alabama cannot lay claim to both crowns forever.</p><p>Ben Raines is an environmental journalist and filmmaker. A longtime newspaper reporter, Raines has won more than two dozen awards for his coverage of environmental issues and natural wonders in Alabama and on the Gulf Coast, and coauthored several peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals. He wrote and directed The Underwater Forest, an award-winning film about the exploration of a 70,000-year-old cypress forest found off the Alabama coast. Raines also wrote and produced the documentary America&#x2019;s Amazon, which has aired on PBS stations around the country and been distributed to public schools across Alabama. His underwater film work has appeared in documentaries on the Discovery Channel and National Geographic TV. Raines co-authored the book Heart of a Patriot with U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, which chronicled Cleland&#x2019;s journey from triple amputee to the Senate. Ben is a graduate of New York University&#x2019;s Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in filmmaking, and is a U.S. Coast Guard-licensed captain, giving tours of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta and Alabama&#x2019;s barrier islands.

And while the pioneering methods they have developed and introduced through their course are based on decision processes in government, their techniques can prove valuable in the upper echelons of business and industry as well. Now, in this long-awaited book, Neustadt and May describe their methods in full.</p><p>Two professors of government analyze both political disasters and successes of recent decades to provide telling lessons on how to use history to improve decision-making. A dozen case studies are drawn in pungent detail both from the record and from backstage information gained from top officials. Sadly, the authors can safely assume a vast ignorance of history in Washington and the media. They make painfully clear that attention to particulars matters, that marginal improvement is worth seeking, and that a little thought is useful. They repeatedly spell out how to examine a situation to help decide what to do today to improve the prospect for tomorrow. An absorbing book, this would be of great benefit to those in Washington, if only they would heed it. For most libraries.

You get up from the couch, you go for a walk, you eat chocolate ice cream. It seems that we're in control of actions like these; if we are, then we have free will. But in recent years, some have argued that free will is an illusion. The neuroscientist (and best-selling author) Sam Harris and the late Harvard psychologist Daniel Wegner, for example, claim that certain scientific findings disprove free will. In this engaging and accessible volume in the Essential Knowledge series, the philosopher Mark Balaguer examines the various arguments and experiments that have been cited to support the claim that human beings don't have free will. He finds them to be overstated and misguided.</p><p>Balaguer discusses determinism, the view that every physical event is predetermined, or completely caused by prior events. He describes several philosophical and scientific arguments against free will, including one based on Benjamin Libet's famous neuroscientific experiments, which allegedly show that our conscious decisions are caused by neural events that occur before we choose. He considers various religious and philosophical views, including the philosophical pro-free-will view known as compatibilism. Balaguer concludes that the anti-free-will arguments put forward by philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists simply don't work. They don't provide any good reason to doubt the existence of free will. But, he cautions, this doesn't necessarily mean that we have free will. The question of whether we have free will remains an open one; we simply don't know enough about the brain to answer it definitively. </p></p><p>Mark Balaguer is Professor in the Department of Philosophy at California State University, Los Angeles.

These were the manuscripts read by the earliest Christians, which comprised their "New Testament." In his volumes, Philip Wesley Comfort bridges the gap between these extant copies and today's critical text by providing accurate transcriptions of the earliest New Testament manuscripts, with photographs on the facing pages so readers can see the works for themselves. Comfort also provides an introduction to each manuscript that summarizes the content, date, current location, provenance, and other essential information, including the latest findings. This allows students and scholars to make well-informed decisions about the translation and interpretation of the New Testament. <br><br>Volume 1 includes manuscripts from Papyrus 1-72. Volume 2 includes manuscripts from Papyrus 75-139 as well as from the uncials. In addition, it features a special section on determining the date of a manuscript. This two-volume set replaces the previously published single volume <i>Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts</i>, as it contains many new manuscripts, updated research, and higher quality images of all manuscripts previously covered. <br><br>"For nearly a generation, Philip Comfort's <i>The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts</i> (Tyndale House, 2001) has been an almost indispensable tool for the many students and scholars who know biblical Greek but whose only acquaintance with the earliest Greek manuscripts is through the textual apparatus of the Nestle or UBS text. This work provides introductions to all the early papyri, plus the actual texts in readable printed Greek. Who could ask for more? Only the passage of time requires more, and Philip Comfort has now supplied it, with a very welcome update of forty-nine more papyri (published since 2001), as well as papyri and uncials of the fourth century. This is a major achievement giving more and more of us a place at the table."-- <b>J. Ramsey Michaels</b>, Missouri State University <br><br>"As a scholar and teacher-preacher, I need to know the evidence for the dating of a particular book and the evidence for the best reading of the text. The compiled Greek New Testaments are handy, but they do not give me enough information. In these present volumes, I get what I want and need for the roughly 190 of the earliest manuscripts rather than relying on cryptic footnotes or chasing around the world to find the actual manuscripts themselves. These volumes include photographs of the manuscripts, discussion of their dating, and transcriptions of their texts. Thank you Philip Comfort and the publisher. I hope the binding is sturdy, for the books will be used." <b>Peter H. Davids</b>, -- Houston Graduate School of Theology <br><br>"The first edition of this book filled a very important need in bringing the earliest New Testament manuscripts in a single space. This second edition only enhances the work's usefulness as it includes more than one hundred new manuscripts. The discussion of the dating of the manuscripts will be of considerable value. All those interested in New Testament textual criticism will find this as an essential tool." -- <b>John N. Oswalt</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary <br><br>"A life's work, now available for the New Testament exegete. This great work presents clear access to the earliest New Testament Greek manuscripts. A magnum opus by Philip Comfort, these useful volumes of the papyri and uncials, provide beyond what students see in the critical apparatus of the Nestle and UBS texts. This is a must-have resource for New Testament exegesis, giving immediate access to the text of each manuscript dated from AD 100 to AD 400. It is a book every New Testament scholar will grow into, as their skills in New Testament exegesis progress. This is a great bargain." -- <b>Jim Swanson</b>, Tyndale House Publishers <br><br>"The earliest manuscripts are a topic of reflection and debate when it comes to the New Testament text. This book gives you the latest, up close look at the first four centuries of manuscripts. This a useful study that reveals the state of the discussion about these important manuscripts."-- <b>Darrell L. Bock</b>, Dallas Theological Seminary <br><br>"This book is an indispensable resource for all students of the New Testament, especially those engaged in New Testament textual criticism. All the features that made the first edition an invaluable reference for the study of the Greek New Testament remain in place. The expanded edition of the volume includes the additional papyri and another fifty manuscripts dated from the fourth century AD.

Away from home for the first time, on a visit to Bath with family friends, Catherine, a passionate consumer of novels (especially of the gothic variety), encounters a world in which everything beckons as a readable text: not only books, but also conversations and behaviors, clothes, carriages, estates, and vistas. In her lively introduction to this newest volume in Harvard's celebrated annotated Austen series, Susan Wolfson proposes that Austen's most underappreciated, most playful novel is about fiction itself and how it can take possession of everyday understandings.</p><p>The first of Austen's major works to be completed (it was revised in 1803 and again in 1816-17), <i>Northanger Abbey</i> was published months after Austen's death in July 1817, together with<i> Persuasion</i>. The 1818 text, whose singularly frustrating course to publication Wolfson recounts, is the basis for this freshly edited and annotated edition.</p><p>Wolfson's running commentary will engage new readers while offering delights for scholars and devoted Janeites. A wealth of color images bring to life Bath society in Austen's era--the parade of female fashions, the carriages running over open roads and through the city's streets, circulating libraries, and nouveau-riche country estates--as well as the larger cultural milieu of <i>Northanger Abbey. </i>This unique edition holds appeal not just for "Friends of Jane" but for all readers looking for a fuller engagement with Austen's extraordinary first novel.</p></p><p>Susan J.

A lyrical exploration of love and loss, <i>The Birds of Opulence</i> centers on several generations of women in a bucolic southern black township as they live with and sometimes surrender to madness.<br><br>The Goode-Brown family, led by matriarch and pillar of the community Minnie Mae, is plagued by old secrets and embarrassment over mental illness and illegitimacy. Meanwhile, single mother Francine Clark is haunted by her dead, lightning-struck husband and forced to fight against both the moral judgment of the community and her own rebellious daughter, Mona. The residents of Opulence struggle with vexing relationships to the land, to one another, and to their own sexuality. As the members of the youngest generation watch their mothers and grandmothers pass away, they live with the fear of going mad themselves and must fight to survive.<br><br>Crystal Wilkinson offers up Opulence and its people in lush, poetic detail. It is a world of magic, conjuring, signs, and spells, but also of harsh realities that only love&#x2015;and love that's handed down&#x2015;can conquer. At once tragic and hopeful, this captivating novel is a story about another time, rendered for our own.</p><p><b>Crystal Wilkinson</b> is the author of <i>Blackberries, Blackberries</i>, winner of the Chaffin Award for Appalachian Literature, and <i>Water Street</i>, a finalist for both the UK's Orange Prize for Fiction and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award.

Wilkinson also writes knowingly about the silences, confusions and half-understood ancestral legends that can exist inside people. This novel meditates on those tensions and confusions by exploring the inner lives of over half a dozen residents of the town of Opulence. <i>The Birds of Opulence</i> is a novel, where every yesterday converges and the reader is almost asked, aren't we all just looking for a little love before we die?

That man was the Zen monk Eihei Dogen. For centuries his main work, <i>Shobogenzo</i>, languished in obscurity, locked away in remote monasteries until scholars rediscovered it in the twentieth century. What took so long? In Brad Warner&#x2019;s view, Dogen was too ahead of his time to find an appreciative audience. To bring Dogen&#x2019;s work to a bigger readership, Warner began paraphrasing <i>Shobogenzo</i>, recasting it in simple, everyday language. The first part of this project resulted in <i>Don&#x2019;t Be a Jerk</i>, and now Warner presents this second volume, <i>It Came from Beyond Zen!</i> Once again, Warner uses wry humor and incisive commentary to bridge the gap between past and present, making Dogen&#x2019;s words clearer and more relevant than ever before.</p><p>Ordained as a Soto Zen priest, <b>Brad Warner</b> is also a punk bassist, filmmaker, and blogger. He is the founder of Angel City Zen Center in Los Angeles and the author of <i>Hardcore Zen</i>, <i>Sit Down and Shut Up</i>, and several other books about Zen Buddhism. His writing appears on SuicideGirls.com and in <i>Lion&#x2019;s Roar</i>, <i>Tricycle</i>, <i>Buddhadharma</i>, and <i>Alternative Press</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;Warner blends accessible language and irreverent humor in his second paraphrase of the work of 13th-century Buddhist monk Dogen (after <em>Don&#x2019;t Be a Jerk</em>). Warner parses both highly philosophical and fairly straightforward works of ethics and shows the range and depth of Dogen&#x2019;s Zen teachings by staying true to the original meanings while excising stumbling blocks for modern readers. . . . Warner&#x2019;s slightly silly but still serious renditions create a charming and readable (though not particularly systematic) exploration of Buddhist approaches to the good life.&#x201d;<br> <strong><em>&#x2014; Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br> <br> <strong>Praise for Brad Warner&#x2019;s <em>Don&#x2019;t Be a Jerk</em><br> <br> </strong>&#x201c;A delightful blend of irreverent everydayness, precise scholarship, and heartfelt commitment to practice.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Stephen Batchelor, author of <em>After Buddhism</em><br> </strong><br> &#x201c;Warner renders the esoteric [Shobogenzo] into a fun, readable text, conveying its spirit with humor and deep respect.&#x201d;<br> <strong><em>&#x2014; Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s clear in reading Warner&#x2019;s book is his deep respect and lifelong engagement with Dogen. . . .While Warner&#x2019;s approach to Dogen may be unorthodox, its freshness might be exactly what the doctor ordered for anyone wanting a way in to the old monk&#x2019;s still fresh perspective.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Adam Frank, <em>13.7:</em> <em>Cosmos &amp; Cultur</em>e blog, NPR.org</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Each chapter opens with a passage from the original, which is then carefully and often humorously unpacked. . . .

But the elusive nature of the man (despite an abundance of documentation), his relentless travel and the control of his own image, together with the complexity of governing the world&#x2019;s first transatlantic empire, complicate the task.<br> &nbsp;<br> Geoffrey Parker, one of the world&#x2019;s leading historians of early modern Europe, has examined the surviving written sources in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish, as well as visual and material evidence. He explores the crucial decisions that created and preserved this vast empire, analyzes Charles&#x2019;s achievements within the context of both personal and structural factors, and scrutinizes the intimate details of the ruler's life for clues to his character and inclinations. The result is a unique biography that interrogates every dimension of Charles&#x2019;s reign and views the world through the emperor&#x2019;s own eyes.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Parker </b>is Andreas Dorpalen Professor of History and associate of the Mershon Center at Ohio State University, and Profesor Afiliado, Divisi�n de Historia, Centro de Investigaci�n y Docencia Econ�micas,&nbsp;Mexico City.

In Parker, he has one. Seldom does one find a work of such profound scholarship delivered in such elegant and engaging prose.

No other living scholar could have organised and analysed the vast and dizzying array of source materials.

In this meticulously- researched and brilliantly- narrated account, Parker strikes a perfect balance,&nbsp;highlighting Charles&#x2019;s strengths as a warrior-king together with his personal weaknesses as a family man. A tour-de-force.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard L. Kagan, author of <i>Clio and the Crown</i><br>&#x201c;Geoffrey Parker&#x2019;s biography of Charles V immediately takes its place as the premier study of the emperor available in English. Its significance, however, like the research that supports it, is global. I cannot remember reading anything that offered so much depth of perspective on both the emperor as a ruler and the age as a whole, the work of Karl Brandi included. It is a masterpiece of historical reconstruction.&#x201d;&#x2014;C.

Wilson is one of the leading biologists and philosophical thinkers of our time. In this compelling collection, Wilson's observations range from the tiny glands of ants to the nature of the living universe. Many of the pieces are considered landmarks in evolutionary biology, ecology, and behavioral biology. Wilson explores topics as diverse as slavery in ants, the genetic basis of societal structure, the discovery of the taxon cycle, the original formulation of the theory of island biogeography, a critique of subspecies as a unit of classification, and the conservation of life's diversity. Each article is presented in its original form, dating from Wilson's first published article in 1949 to his most recent exploration of the natural world. Preceding each piece is a brief essay by Wilson that explains the context in which the article was written and provides insights into the scientist himself and the debates of the time.</p><p>This collection enables us to share Wilson's various vantage points and to view the complexities of nature through his eyes. Wilson aficionados, along with readers discovering his work for the first time, will find in this collection a world of beauty, complexity, and challenge.</p></p><p><p><b>Edward O. Wilson </b> is an entomologist and biologist known for his pioneering work on evolution and sociobiology, and is often referred to as the father of sociobiology and modern biodiversity studies. He has authored many books, including <i>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</i> (1975), <i>On Human Nature</i> (winner of a 1979 Pulitzer Prize), <i>The Ants</i> (winner of a 1991 Pulitzer Prize), and <i>Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge</i> (1998). He has received over one hundred awards, many of them international, in science and letters.

In documenting the artist's pioneering woodcuts, deft collages, and compelling paintings in oil and acrylic, Bartelik interweaves facts and stories of Yunkers' long life with commentary on his prodigious output. Not content to be pigeonholed into categories, Yunkers remained true to himself by pursuing an artistic path of new ideas, thus liberating his work from a static stylistic trajectory. Toward the end of his days, Yunkers created sublime compositions imbued with a serene presence that could be likened to the inner tranquility experienced in a garden. Bartelik's well-researched effort presents a revelatory portrayal of this significant artist. <i>Alice Joyce</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Crafted from the ground up to be a &#34;brief&#34; U.S. History text (rather than a condensed version of a larger text), WE THE PEOPLE tells the story of America through five recurring, interwoven themes: (1) the role of interacting cultures in the development of the American nation; (2) the social/cultural environment&#39;s interaction with political forces; (3) the evolution of a national identity; (4) changing cultural values; and (5) individuals&#39; attempts to impose order on physical place and chronological time. Frequent quotations from individuals at all levels of society make this text well-rounded in its presentation of social and cultural history. In addition, each chapter opens with a story that features a longer quotation that illuminates the topics, events, and themes explicated in that chapter. WE THE PEOPLE is available in the following split options: WE THE PEOPLE, Complete, First Edition (Chapters 1-30), ISBN: 0534593550; WE THE PEOPLE, Volume I to 1877 (Chapters 1-15), ISBN: 0534593569; WE THE PEOPLE, Volume II, Since 1865 (Chapters 15-30), ISBN: 0534593577.</p><p>Peter N. Carroll was born in Queens, New York, and received his B.A. from Queens College and his history Ph.D. from Northwestern University. He has taught the U.S. history survey course at the University of Illinois, the University of Minnesota, and San Francisco State University; consulted on literally dozens of textbooks; and worked with survey course teachers for the National Faculty in the 1990s. He also works with his local high school&#39;s AP U.S. history survey course. He has also taught U.S. cultural and intellectual history at the University of Minnesota, Stanford University, the University of San Francisco, and the University of California at Berkeley. Carroll&#39;s publications include IT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED: AMERICA IN THE 1970S, rev. ed. (Rutgers University, 1990), KEEPING TIME: MEMORY, NOSTALGIA, AND THE ART OF HISTORY (University of Georgia Press, 1990), and AMERICANS IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR: THE ODYSSEY OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN BRIGADE (Stanford University Press, 1994). Carroll and his partner, author Jeannette Ferrary, live in Belmont, California."I really like this text. It is readable and covers very interesting material. I would rate it superior to Tindall. I would also say that it is an important competitor to the better long editions like Norton and Henretta. ... The introduction of chapters that cover broad material with single stories (the creation story or Isabella's introduction to an 'instrument of empire') is interesting, and nicely tied to the more general introduction to the chapter. ... What continues to be positive in this chapter is the inclusion of individual voices. ... the first six chapters are well written, contain interesting and relevant information, and together present a coherent and cogent narrative. As someone who struggles every semester with how to present a 'survey' of American history, I appreciate the complexity and, at the same time, the simplicity of this narrative. Yes, I would consider adopting this text."<br><br>"Peter Carroll's WE THE PEOPLE is a very good concise text judging from the initial six chapters. Carroll's format is consistent, his examples appropriate, and his ability as a writer excellent. ... Wadsworth's goal of a "lively brief narrative" by a single author has been met and perhaps exceeded. This will be a popular survey text. â�&#x201a;�¦ Carroll's text is a way to encourage more students to be successful. ... Students who read this text will be thoroughly entertained with the explicit descriptions and comparisons of cultures and genders. ... The chapter introductions are superior. That is one of the reasons why I believe the text can appeal to a broader audience. ... In the ... chapters read, I see no major weaknesses, only strengths. These strengths come from his treatment of the themes in a precise way. In quality the chapters are superior to those of 'usual' survey texts who try to please all and really please no one. The author has presented interesting material without sacrificing important themes. ... Few survey texts are as well written. Thank you for asking me to review this excellent addition to American survey textbooks.... I would love to adopt this text."<br><br>"I find this text far superior to more traditional texts like Garraty or Bailey in its coverage of social issues. It has ... less detail than the Norton text I currently use, but that may be an asset as it seems to read better and not to overwhelm the reader with too much detail. ...."<br><br>"These chapters seems very well organized overall and are quite comprehensive. The writing is attractive and should hold the students' attention. ... I certainly enjoy and admire the social and cultural history contained here and praise the author for presenting it so well."<br><br>"I was struck ... at the skillful way in which Professor Carroll was able to integrate social/cultural and political history and to reveal the dialectical relationship between them. Here he sustains my admiration for his work. ...Professor Carroll's prose style flows well. The vocabulary he employs does not intimidate the reader, nor does it condescend. Carroll tells good stories when there are stories to be told, and he develops his analytical points with admirable clarity."</p><h2>Decoding Strategies: Decoding B1, Teacher&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Corrective Reading provides intensive intervention for students in Grades 4-12 who are reading one or more years below grade level.

After all, in his blazing career, Nietzsche took aim at nearly all the foundations of modern American life: Christian morality, the Enlightenment faith in reason, and the idea of human equality. Despite that, for more than a century Nietzsche has been a hugely popular&#x2014;and surprisingly influential&#x2014;figure in American thought and culture. <br><br>In <i>American Nietzsche</i>, Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen delves deeply into Nietzsche's philosophy, and America&#x2019;s reception of it, to tell the story of his curious appeal. Beginning her account with Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom the seventeen-year-old Nietzsche read fervently, she shows how Nietzsche&#x2019;s ideas first burst on American shores at the turn of the twentieth century, and how they continued&nbsp; alternately to invigorate and to shock Americans for the century to come. She also delineates the broader intellectual and cultural contexts within which a wide array of commentators&#x2014;academic and armchair philosophers, theologians and atheists, romantic poets and hard-nosed empiricists, and political ideologues and apostates from the Left and the Right&#x2014;drew insight and inspiration from Nietzsche&#x2019;s claims for the death of God, his challenge to universal truth, and his insistence on the interpretive nature of all human thought and beliefs. At the same time, she explores how his image as an iconoclastic immoralist was put to work in American popular culture, making Nietzsche an unlikely posthumous celebrity capable of inspiring both teenagers and scholars alike. <br><br>A &nbsp;penetrating examination of a powerful but little-explored undercurrent of twentieth-century American thought and culture, <i>American Nietzsche</i> dramatically recasts our understanding of American intellectual life&#x2014;and puts Nietzsche squarely at its heart.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen</b> is the&nbsp;Merle Curti Assistant Professor of&nbsp;History at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin, Madison.<p>"Today's inescapable and perplexing Nietzsche is not necessarily the same Nietzsche who inspired readers in the past; and it's the achievement of <i>American Nietzsche</i> to show how that is the case."</p> (Alexander Star <i>New York&nbsp;Times Book&nbsp;Review</i>)<br><br><p>"This is a superb book, widely and imaginatively researched, boldly argued, and vigorously written. The story it tells is compelling and populated by a fascinating array of characters, including almost everyone of importance in nineteenth- and twentieth-century American intellectual history: including Emerson, William James, Santayana, Mencken, and a host of lesser folk."</p> (Jackson Lears)<br><br>"More than any other European thinker, Nietzsche is alive in our cultural bloodstream. . . . What does our use and abuse of&nbsp;Nietzsche's thinking say about us?&nbsp;This is the interesting question that Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen sets out to answer in her elegant and revealing account of America's reckoning with the German thinker." (Thomas Meaney <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"[A] lively history. . . . With vigor and intelligence, <i>American Nietzsche </i>covers a great deal of ground. . . . Ratner-Rosenhagen is a superb listener."&#x2014;<i>Nation</i> (<i>Nation</i>)<br><br><p>"The major lesson of Ratner-Rosenhagen&#x2019;s book, and its comedy, lies in her demonstration of how deftly the American genius has drawn on Nietzsche but cushioned and contained his challenge to democracy, religion, and humanitarianism in general."</p><p></p> (Adam Kirsch <i>Prospect</i>)<br><br>"Ratner-Rosenhagen's skillful combining of historical research and philosophical analysis in a way that is both accessible and informative makes this book a pleasure to read. Highly recommended." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Ratner-Rosenhagen's book, while technically the work of an intellectual historian, . . should be made compulsory reading for philosophers." (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>American Nietzsche</i> is an original contribution to trans-Atlantic intellectual history. Imaginatively conceived, it sheds considerable light on the still neglected influence of German thought on American thought and culture from Emerson down to the present. On top of that, Ratner-Rosenhagen deals with her surprisingly fresh topic in a lively, sharp, and often witty prose that is a pleasure to read."</p> (Richard King, University of Nottingham)<br><br><p>"A luminous and wide-ranging story of the depth and passion of American readers' attraction to Nietzsche. This is transnational intellectual history at its very best."</p> (Daniel T. Rodgers, Princeton University)<br><br>"An exquisitely and exhaustively researched work. . . . <i>American Nietzsche</i> argues that all appropriation [of Nietzsche] get the man wrong&#x2014;or, at least, that none get him entirely right&#x2014;but that the error is sort of beside the point, because each misappropriation is put to use in the grand, century-long project of helping America understand itself."

Individual religions may vary through time and geographically, but there is an element, religion, that is to be found in all cultures during all time periods. Taking apart this assumption, Brent Nongbri shows that the idea of religion as a sphere of life distinct from politics, economics, or science is a recent development in European history&#x2014;a development that has been projected outward in space and backward in time with the result that religion now appears to be a natural and necessary part of our world.</p><p>Examining a wide array of ancient writings, Nongbri demonstrates that in antiquity, there was no conceptual arena that could be designated as &#x201c;religious&#x201d; as opposed to &#x201c;secular.&#x201d; Surveying representative episodes from a two-thousand-year period, while constantly attending to the concrete social, political, and colonial contexts that shaped relevant works of philosophers, legal theorists, missionaries, and others, Nongbri offers a concise and readable account of the emergence of the concept of religion.</p></p><p><b>Brent Nongbri </b>is a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.<br> &nbsp;"Compelling . . . a thought-provoking addition to scholarship on religion, history, and culture."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"So, although <i>Before Religion </i>understandably comes well after many of the works that helped to establish this field of study, it is likely the best way into the literature on &#x201c;religion&#x201d; for the newcomer (and thus Nongbri&#x2019;s work has the effect of helping to constitute this focus <i>as </i>a legitimate specialty).

Even if one does not agree with all of his conclusions, the study of 'religion,'&nbsp;be it in antiquity or today, will never be the same after the standards set by his book."&#x2014;Jan Bremmer, University of Groningen<br>"Inevitably, we use our own concepts to make sense of the past; failing to realize this, however, is an indictment of our work. Luckily, Brent Nongbri&#x2019;s genealogy of the concept &#x2018;religion&#x2019; will help keep scholars honest by making it tougher for them to portray their modern interpretations as disinterested descriptions."&#x2014;Russell T.

Authors Peter von Sivers, Charles A. Desnoyers, and George B. Stow examine the full range of human ingenuity over time and space in a comprehensive, evenhanded, and critical fashion. <br><br>The authors offer a distinct intellectual framework for the role of innovation and historical change through patterns of <strong>origins, interactions, </strong>and<strong> adaptations</strong>. Each small or large technical or cultural innovation originated in one geographical center or independently in several different centers. As people in the centers interacted with their neighbors, the neighbors adapted to--and in many cases were transformed by--the innovations. By "adaptation" the authors include the entire spectrum of human responses, ranging from outright rejection to creative borrowing and, at times, forced acceptance. Seeing patterns of various kinds in historical development brings to light connections and linkages among peoples, cultures, and regions that might not otherwise present themselves.<br><br>Such patterns can also reveal differences among cultures that other approaches to world history tend to neglect. For example, the differences between the civilizations of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres are generally highlighted in world history texts, but the broad commonalities of human groups creating agriculturally-based cities and states in widely separated areas also show deep parallels in their patterns of origins, interactions, and adaptations. Such comparisons are at the center of <em>Patterns of World History</em>. This kind of analysis offers insights into how an individual innovation was subsequently developed and diffused across time and space--that is, the patterns by which the new eventually becomes a necessity in daily lives. Through all of this we gain a deeper appreciation of the unfolding of global history from its origins in small, isolated areas to the vast networks of global interconnectedness in our present world.<br><br>The authors' use of a broad-based understanding of continuity, change, and innovation allows them to restore culture in all its individual and institutionalized aspects--spiritual, artistic, intellectual, scientific--to its rightful place alongside technology, environment, politics, and socioeconomic conditions. Understanding innovation in this way allows this text to help illuminate the full range of human ingenuity over time and space in a comprehensive, evenhanded, and open-ended fashion.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter von Sivers</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Utah.<br><br><strong>Charles A.

When his first novel is published, it brings him the fame he has sought, but it also brings the censure of his neighbors back home, who are outraged by his depiction of them. Unsettled by their reaction and unsure of himself and his future, Webber begins a search for a greater understanding of his artistic identity that takes him deep into New York&#x2019;s hectic social whirl; to London with an uninhibited group of expatriates; and to Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler&#x2019;s shadow. He discovers a world plagued by political uncertainty and on the brink of transformation, yet he finds within himself the capacity to meet it with optimism and a renewed love for his birthplace. He is a changed man yet a hopeful one, awake to the knowledge that one can never fully &#x201c;go back home to your family, back home to your childhood...away from all the strife and conflict of the world...back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>This novel was the last Thomas Wolfe finished before his untimely death at age 37. In its brilliance, we find more cause to wish he had lived longer. As with his other novels, <i>You Can't Go Home Again</i> is an extremely personal work, but in the character of George Webber, a writer, Wolfe sees and captures America and the world in an dramatic time in history. The time is the period just before the great stock market crash and it stretches through the Depression and into Germany during the rise of Nazis. And the writer of course is Wolfe, who takes us on a ride through America never seen before--one with sharp insight and breathtaking flair.George Webber has written a successful novel about his family and hometown. When he returns to that town he is shaken by the force of the outrage and hatred that greets him. Family and friends feel naked and exposed by the truths they have seen in his book, and their fury drives him from his home. He begins a search for his own identity that takes him to New York and a hectic social whirl; to Paris with an uninhibited group of expatriates; to Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler&#39;s shadow. At last Webber returns to America and rediscovers it with love, sorrow, and hope.</p><h2>Becker&#39;s World of the Cell (8th Edition)</h2><p><p>Widely praised for its strong biochemistry coverage, <b>Becker&#x2019;s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition,</b> provides a clear, up-to-date introduction to cell biology concepts, processes, and applications.&nbsp;Informed by many years of teaching the introductory cell biology course, the authors have added new emphasis on modern genetic/genomic/proteomic approaches to cell biology while using clear language to ensure that students comprehend the material. <b>Becker&#x2019;s World of the Cell</b> provides accessible and authoritative descriptions of all major principles, as well as unique scientific insights into visualization and applications of cell biology.</p></p><p><p> <b>Jeff Hardin</b> is Professor and Chair of the Zoology Department at the University of Wisconsin&#x2014;Madison.

Lord George Gordon's dangerous appeal to old religious prejudices is interwoven with the murder mystery surrounding the father of the simple-minded Barnaby. The discovery of the murderer and his involvement in the riots put Barnaby's life in jeopardy. Culminating in the terrifying destruction of Newgate prison by the rampaging hordes, the brilliant descriptions of the riots are among Dickens's most powerful. <em>Barnaby Rudge</em> looks forward to the dark complexities of Dickens's later novels, whose characters also seek refuge from a chaotic and unstable world. This edition includes all the original illustrations, plus an illuminating Introduction and notes.<br><strong></strong> About the Series: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

More than 5,000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians founded one of the world&#39;s oldest civilizations. We know of its pyramids, art, and pharaohs. But what was life really like then? Ordinary citizens in ancient Egypt lived and worked in much the same ways as the average European of the eighteenth century, but ate better, had more practical clothing and lived more comfortably, in houses with patios, latrines, and cooling systems. Through deep investigative research, the authors explore the social and material existence in ancient Egypt-from what people ate and drank to how they worked, lived, played, and prayed. Features color and black-and-white images throughout, along with maps.</p><p>Bob Brier is senior research fellow at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University.

General-reader interest in the two cultures broadens to include everyday life, making these two works a welcome addition to most libraries. Both start with a time line and historical overview of their respective civilizations, but the bulk of the material is devoted to the lives of ordinary people. Each book covers society, religion, private and public life, technology and science, economics, leisure, clothing and fashion, cuisine, and other aspects of daily living. Readers learn how similar they are to us; for example, the Egyptians were fond of hunting and fishing, and the Greeks kept pets. Readers will also see how different they were from us, as the Greek sense of citizenship was very different from our contemporary one, and the Egyptians used a blend of empirical observation and magic in their medical practice&#x2014;both aspects coexisted in harmony. Where the references differ is how they approach their narratives. The focus seems sharper in Ancient Egypt&#x2014;although comparisons to contemporary living are ubiquitous, this book uses analogies to help readers better understand the salient conditions pharaonic Egyptians faced. On the other hand, Ancient Greece draws out the similarities and differences between ancient Greek society and contemporary Western society. And indeed, the last chapter discusses ancient Greece&#x2019;s impact on contemporary society, while there is no such comparison in Ancient Egypt. A possible reason for the different approaches could be that ancient Greece is seen as a foundation for modern democracies, and hence the text is comparing current society with what is regarded as the original prototype of modern democratic society. As life in ancient Egypt does not have such a strong connection with contemporary society, the focus is more on understanding the civilization than on drawing a comparison. Both are excellent works, given their varying objectives. There are color maps, photographs, and reproductions dotting the text of both books, and they each have a glossary, an index, and an extensive bibliography for those interested in additional research. The bibliographies in both works cite books as well as websites. Ancient Greece also cites additional audiovisual works and thematically classifies its references (while Ancient Egypt is footnoted). Although the references may seem dated (most are from the 1980s and &#x2019;90s), they are still relevant in depth and scope for most middle- and high-school students. For the price and level of coverage, both works are well suited for school projects that require students to go beyond their standard textbooks, and also for general readers interested in ancient Greece or pharaonic Egypt. Recommended for school and public libraries. --Muhammed Hassanali</p><h2>Strategies &amp; Tactics for the MBE 2, Second Edition (Emanuel Bar Review Series)</h2><p>A comprehensive resource created in the successful style of <b>Strategies &amp; Tactics for the MBE</b>, <b>Strategies &amp; Tactics for the MBE 2</b> provides 300 additional questions to help you prepare for the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE)! <p></p> <p> Success on the MBE can often influence whether you pass or fail the Bar Exam.

No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</p><p><b>CLASS DOMAINS</b></p><p>The following discussion elaborates on the major domains of classroom experience assessed by the CLASS. A more complete discussion of the theoretical and empirical basis for the CLASS is available elsewhere (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2007, La Paro, Pianta, &amp; Stuhlman, 2004).</p><p>Emotional Support</p><p>Children's social and emotional functioning in the classroom is increasingly recognized as an indicator of school readiness (Blair, 2002; Denham &amp; Weissberg, 2004; Raver, 2004), a potential target for intervention (Greenberg, Weissberg, &amp; O'Brien, 2003; Zins, Bloodworth, Weissberg, &amp; Walberg, 2004), and even a student outcome that might be governed by a set of standards similar to those for academic achievement (Illinois State Board of Education, 2004). Children who are motivated and connected to others in the early years of schooling are much more likely to establish positive trajectories of development in both social and academic domains (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001; Ladd, Birch, &amp; Buhs, 1999; Pianta, Steinberg, &amp; Rollins, 1995; Silver, Measelle, Essex, &amp; Armstrong, 2005). Teachers' abilities to support social and emotional functioning in the classroom are therefore central to any conceptualization of effective classroom practice. The dimensions included in the Emotional Support domain on the CLASS include the following:</p><ul><li>Positive Climate: The emotional connection, respect, and enjoyment demonstrated between teachers and students and among students<br><br></li><li>Negative Climate: The level of expressed negativity such as anger, hostility, or aggression exhibited by teachers and/or students in the classroom<br><br></li><li>Teacher Sensitivity: Teachers' awareness of and responsivity to students' academic and emotional concerns<br><br></li><li>Regard for Student Perspectives: The degree to which teachers' interactions with students and classroom activities place an emphasis on students' interests, motivations, and points of view<br><br></li></ul><p>These dimensions collectively and separately predict to students' performance on standardized tests of literacy skills in preschool and first grade (NICHD ECCRN, 2003; Pianta, 2003), levels of mother&#x2013;reported internalizing behaviors in kindergarten and first grade (NICHD ECCRN, 2003), and students' engagement in the classroom across all grade levels (Bryant et al., 2002; NICHD ECCRN 2002, 2005).</p><p>Although these processes are important for all students, they may be particularly important for students at risk for school failure. For example, among a group of students who displayed significant behavior and emotional problems in kindergarten, those who were placed in first&#x2013;grade classrooms offering high levels of emotional support made academic progress at levels similar to their low&#x2013;risk peers, whereas high&#x2013;risk students placed in classrooms offering lower levels of emotional support fell further behind their low&#x2013;risk peers (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2005). These studies demonstrate that emotional support in the classroom uniquely predicts student outcomes, after adjusting for selection effects and prior student functioning.</p><p><b>Classroom Organization</b></p><p>The Classroom Organization domain includes a broad array of classroom processes related to the organization and management of students' behavior, time, and attention in the classroom (Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001). Classrooms function best and provide the most opportunities for learning when students are well&#x2013;behaved, consistently have things to do, and are interested and engaged in learning tasks. The theoretical underpinnings of this domain include work by developmental psychologists studying how children develop self&#x2013;regulatory skills (Blair, 2003; Raver, 2004), work by ecological psychologists examining the extent to which these skills are determined by environmental factors (Kounin, 1970), and constructivist theories exploring how young children are best engaged in learning (Bowman &amp; Stott, 1994; Bruner, 1996; Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978). The term <i>self&#x2013;regulated learning</i> (Schunk, 2005; Sperling, Howard, &amp; Staley, 2004) often is used to refer to the regulatory skills students need to be successful in classroom settings. This term is defined as "an active constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features in the environment" (Pintrich, 2000, p. 453). A point of emphasis across this definition and the work of other ecological and process-product researchers is that the development and expression of regulatory skills is highly dependent on the classroom environment (Anderson, Evertson, &amp; Emmer, 1980; Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001; Kounin, 1970; Pintrich, 2000; Sanford &amp; Evertson, 1981; Soar &amp; Soar, 1979). At the simplest level, this work suggests that students exhibit better self&#x2013;regulation in well&#x2013;regulated classroom environments. The CLASS framework incorporates three dimensions of this classroom&#x2013;level regulation:</p><ul><li>Behavior Management: How effectively teachers monitor, prevent, and redirect behavior<br><br></li><li>Productivity: How well the classroom runs with respect to routines and the degree to which teachers organize activities and directions so that maximum time can be spent in learning activities<br><br></li><li>Instructional Learning Formats: How teachers facilitate activities and provide interesting materials so that students are engaged and learning opportunities are maximized<br></li></ul><p>Each of these dimensions captures a distinct aspect of classroom organization that has demonstrated associations with children's learning. With regard to behavior management, classrooms with positive strategies for preventing and redirecting behavior tend to have students who make greater academic progress (Good &amp; Grouws, 1977; Soar &amp; Soar, 1979). In addition, intervention studies provide evidence that teachers who adopt these types of practices after training are more likely than teachers in control groups to have students who are engaged and learning (Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001; Evertson, Emmer, Sanford, &amp; Clements, 1983; Evertson &amp; Harris, 1999). In terms of productivity, early work by process&amp;8211;product researchers has focused attention on the importance of time management, providing consistent evidence that students are most engaged in productive classrooms and that this engagement, in turn, is directly associated with student learning (Brophy &amp; Evertson, 1976; Coker, Medley, &amp; Soar, 1980; Good &amp; Grouws, 1977; Stallings, 1975; Stallings, Cory, Fairweather, &amp; Needels, 1978). In fact, in their review of teacher behavior and student achievement, Brophy and Good (1986) concluded that the link between the <i>quantity</i> of time spent on instruction and student achievement was the most consistently replicated finding of process&#x2013;product researchers. Finally, for students to learn they must not only have something to do but also must be effectively engaged and interested in the instructional activities provided to them as well (Yair, 2000). Consistent with constructivist theories that guide much of early childhood practice (Bowman &amp; Stott, 1994; Bruner, 1996; Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978), when teachers provide high&#x2013;quality learning formats, students are not just <i>passively</i> engaged in learning but are <i>active</i> participants in the learning experience. Taken together, these dimensions of classroom organization set the stage for learning in preschool to third&#x2013;grade classrooms.</p><p><b>Instructional Support</b></p><p>The theoretical foundation for the CLASS conceptualization of instructional support comes primarily from research on children's cognitive and language development (e.g., Catts, Fey, Zhang, &amp; Tomblin, 1999; Fujiki, Brinton, &amp; Clarke, 2002; Romberg, Carpenter, &amp; Dremock, 2005; Taylor, Pearson, Peterson, &amp; Rodriguez, 2003; Vygotsky, 1991; Wharton&#x2013;McDonald, Pressley, &amp; Hampston, 1998). This literature highlights the distinction between simply learning facts and gaining <i>usable knowledge</i>&#x2014;learning how facts are interconnected, organized, and conditioned on one another (National Research Council, 1999)&#x2014;noting that gaining usable knowledge is the more important of the two when it comes to cognitive development. The development of <i>metacognitive skills</i>, or the awareness and understanding of one's thinking processes, also is critical to children's academic development (Veenman, Kok, &amp; Bl�te, 2005; Williams, Blythe, &amp; White, 2002). A child's ability to develop metacognitive skills is contingent on the opportunities that adults provide to express existing skills and scaffold more complex ones (Davis &amp; Miyake, 2004; Skibbe, Behnke, &amp; Justice, 2004; Vygotsky, 1991). Thus, as with the other CLASS domains, interactions between adults and children are the key mechanism through which instructional support is provided to children in the early years of schooling. As a result, the CLASS Instructional Support domain does not focus on the content of curriculum or learning activities but rather on the ways in which teachers implement whichever curriculum they are using to effectively support cognitive and language development. The CLASS has three dimensions that focus on instructional support:</p><ul><li>Concept Development: How teachers use instructional discussions and activities to promote students' higher&#x2013;order thinking skills in contrast to a focus on rote instruction<br><br></li><li>Quality of Feedback: How teachers extend students' learning through their responses to students' ideas, comments, and work<br><br></li><li>Language Modeling: The extent to which teachers facilitate and encourage students' language<br></li></ul><p>These dimensions together, and Quality of Feedback in particular, form an index of the instructional value of the classroom that predicts to student academic functioning in the areas of literacy and general knowledge (Howes et al., in press), with indications that this association is a result of increased student engagement in the activity (NICHD ECCRN, 2003).</p><p></p>As with emotional support, there is some evidence that these instructional processes may be particularly important for students at risk for school failure. In one study, students identified as at risk based on low levels of maternal education who were placed in first&#x2013;grade classrooms offering moderate to high instructional quality displayed academic achievement at a level commensurate with their low&#x2013;risk peers, whereas those students in low instructional quality classrooms fell further behind (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2005).<p></p><p><b>Low Language Modeling (1, 2)</b></p><p><b><i>There are few if any conversations in the classroom.</i></b> Few individual, small&#x2013;group, and/or large&#x2013;group conversations occur between the students and the teacher. In classrooms at the low end of the Language Modeling dimension, the teacher rarely initiates conversations with students and does not engage conversationally with students during center time or other open periods of time. If students talk to the teacher, the teacher rarely responds with more than a few words. In addition, there are few, if any, back&#x2013;and&#x2013;forth exchanges between the teacher and students. The conversations that do occur in the classroom are primarily teacher&#x2013;controlled and focus on students' behavior, classroom management, or teaching a particular concept or skill. Teacher&#x2013;controlled conversations are those in which the teacher selects the conversational topic, limits students' answers, and/or does not wait patiently for students to respond. For instance, large&#x2013;group time for a classroom scoring at the low end of this dimension would include a preponderance of closed&#x2013;ended questions and little recasting or repeating of students' responses, such as the following:</p>Teacher: Show me your right hand.<br><br> [Students raise right hand.]<br><br> Teacher: Good. Teresa, point to your left.<br><br> [Teresa points to left.]<br><br> Teacher: Good job. Who is on your left, everyone?<br><br> [Students say names of classmates.]<br><br> Teacher: That's right. Nice work.<p>In this interaction, the students have little or no opportunity to initiate conversation; the teacher is setting the pace and the conversational focus, no extended turn taking is present, and the students' communicative participation is highly constrained. Classrooms receiving a low score on this dimension are characterized by a high frequency of this type of teacher&#x2014;student interaction. Students do not initiate conversation with their peers and rarely, if ever, engage in extended conversations with one another. The students primarily direct their comments to the teacher.</p><p><b><i>The majority of the teacher's questions are closed&#x2013;ended.</i></b> The teacher consistently asks questions that require no more than a one&#x2013;word answer or short sentence (e.g., "What is this?" "What color is it?" "Where is it?" "How many are there?") Students rarely, if ever, have opportunities to respond to the teacher with more complex language.</p><p><b><i>The teacher rarely, if ever, repeats or extends the students' responses.</i></b> When students make comments or ask questions, the teacher does not respond to the comment or answer the question and/or ignores the student's communicative attempt. For example, while the teacher is reading a story to the class, a student points to and makes a comment about a bird in the illustration: "Look, there's a blue bird." The teacher either continues to read, ignoring the student's comment, or simply says, "Yes, a bird."</p><p><b><i>The teacher rarely maps his or her own actions and the students' actions through language and description.</i></b> The teacher does not use self&#x2013;talk or parallel talk in conversation or instruction. For example, when he is writing something on the board, he simply writes, rather than using it as an opportunity to link his actions to language by saying something such as, "Now I am writing a <i>B,</i> then an <i>O</i>, then an <i>A</i>, then a <i>T</i>." During play with students, he fails to use parallel talk to describe what the students are doing such as, "Wow, you are building a tall tower; you are putting another block on top and then another."</p><p><b><i>The teacher does not use advanced language with students.</i></b> The vocabulary that the teacher uses to explain concepts to the students is limited and lacks variety.

But for the last fifty years, the novel&#x2019;s celebrated author, Harper Lee, has said almost nothing on the record. Journalists have trekked to her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, where Harper Lee, known to her friends as Nelle, has lived with her sister, Alice, for decades, trying and failing to get an interview with the author. But in 2001, the Lee sisters opened their door to <i>Chicago Tribune </i>journalist Marja Mills. It was the beginning of a long conversation&#x2014;and a great friendship.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2004, with the Lees&#x2019; blessing, Mills moved into the house next door to the sisters. She spent the next eighteen months there, sharing coffee at McDonalds and trips to the Laundromat with Nelle, feeding the ducks and going out for catfish supper with the sisters, and exploring all over lower Alabama with the Lees&#x2019; inner circle of friends.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nelle shared her love of history, literature, and the Southern way of life with Mills, as well as her keen sense of how journalism should be practiced. As the sisters decided to let Mills tell their story, Nelle helped make sure she was getting the story&#x2014;and the South&#x2014;right. Alice, the keeper of the Lee family history, shared the stories of their family.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Mockingbird Next Door </i>is the story of Mills&#x2019;s friendship with the Lee sisters. It is a testament to the great intelligence, sharp wit, and tremendous storytelling power of these two women, especially that of Nelle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mills was given a rare opportunity to know Nelle Harper Lee, to be part of the Lees&#x2019; life in Alabama, and to hear them reflect on their upbringing, their corner of the Deep South, how <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> affected their lives, and why Nelle Harper Lee chose to never write another novel.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2014:</strong> In 2001, <em>Chicago Tribune</em> journalist Marja Mills traveled to Monroeville, Alabama in search of something that no other journalist had been able to land: an interview with the reclusive Harper Lee. Instead, she got an interview with her older sister, Alice--content with that, Mills prepared to return to Chicago to write her story. But then she got word that Lee (known as &#x201c;Nelle&#x201d; to those close to her) wanted to sit down for a &#x201c;visit.&#x201d; Many visits later they were friends, and in 2004 Mills was even invited to move in next door to the Lee sisters&#x2019; home. Underneath the plain, clear language of <em>The Mockingbird Next Door</em> is an enchanting, atmospheric portrait of two sisters and the southern town they inhabit (when Harper Lee is not living in New York). Mills makes a point of avoiding gossip, but that hardly matters. The book is compelling and charming; and it brings Harper Lee and her world, both past and present, to full life. <em>--Chris Schluep</em></p>Marja Mills is a former reporter for the <i>Chicago&nbsp;Tribune</i> and a staff Pulitzer Prize winner for a 2001 series&nbsp;about O&#x2019;Hare Airport entitled &#x201c;Gateway to Gridlock.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>The Mockingbird Next Door</i> is her first book.</p><h2>The Kings and Queens of England and Scotland</h2><p>Offers brief profiles of each British monarch, and looks at events, places, objects, and rituals associated with the British throne</p><p></p><h2>David Copperfield (Clarendon Dickens)</h2><p>This book has clothback covers.Ex-library,With usual stamps and markings,In good all round condition.</p><p>Please note that this is an MP3-CD. This is also available on cassette.<p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories (Scribner Classics)</h2><p>The ideal introduction to the genius of Ernest Hemingway, <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories</i> contains ten of Hemingway's most acclaimed and popular works of short fiction. Selected from <i>Winner Take Nothing, Men Without Women,</i> and <i>The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories,</i> this collection includes "The Killers," the first of Hemingway's mature stories to be accepted by an American periodical; the autobiographical "Fathers and Sons," which alludes, for the first time in Hemingway's career, to his father's suicide; "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," a "brilliant fusion of personal observation, hearsay and invention," wrote Hemingway's biographer, Carlos Baker; and the title story itself, of which Hemingway said: "I put all the true stuff in," with enough material, he boasted, to fill four novels. Beautiful in their simplicity, startling in their originality, and unsurpassed in their craftsmanship, the stories in this volume highlight one of America's master storytellers at the top of his form.</p><p>Returning from a Kenyan safari in 1932, Ernest Hemingway quickly devised a literary trophy to add to his stash of buffalo hides and rhino horns. To this day, <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> seems an almost perverse paean to the thrills of bloodshed, in which the author cuts one notch after another in his gun barrel and declares, "I did not mind killing anything." Four years later, however, Hemingway came up with a more accomplished spin on his African experiences--a pair of them, in fact, which he collected with eight other tales in <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>. The title story is a meditation on corruption and mortality, two subjects that were already beginning to preoccupy the 37-year-old author. As the protagonist perishes of gangrene out in the bush, he recognizes his own failure of nerve as a writer: <blockquote>Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.</blockquote> In the story, at least, the hero gets some points for stoic acceptance, as well as an epiphanic vision of Kilimanjaro's summit, "wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun." (The movie version is another matter: Gregory Peck makes it back to the hospital, loses a leg, and is a better person for it.) But Hemingway's <i>other</i> great white hunter, in "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," is granted a less dignified exit. This time the issue is cowardice, another of Papa's bugaboos: poor Francis is too wimpy to face down a wounded lion, let alone satisfy his treacherous wife in bed. Yet he does manage a last-minute triumph before dying--an absolute assertion of courage--which makes the title a hair less ironic than it initially seems. No wonder these are two of the highest-caliber (so to speak) tales in the Hemingway canon. <i>--Bob Brandeis</i>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.</p><h2>The St. Martin&#39;s Handbook with 2016 MLA update</h2><p><p>Transition from informal, social writing, to effective academic writing, to writing that can change the world with the extensive advice and practice found in <em>St. Martin's Handbook with 2016 MLA update</em>.</p><br><p></p></p><p><b>Andrea Lunsford</b>, Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor of English emerita and former Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University, joined the Stanford faculty in 2000.

The actual date of his birth is not known, but traditionally April 23rd 1564 (St George&#39;s Day) has been his accepted birthday, as this was three days before his baptism. He died on the same date in 1616, aged fifty-two. The life of William Shakespeare can be divided into three acts. The first twenty years of his life were spent in Stratford-upon-Avon where he grew up, went to school, got married and became a father. The next twenty-five years he spent as an actor and playwright in London; and he spent his last few years back in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he enjoyed his retirement in moderate wealth gained from his successful years in the theatre.William was the eldest son of tradesman John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, and the third of eight children. His father was later elected mayor of Stratford, which was the highest post a man in civic politics could attain. In sixteenth-century England, William was lucky to survive into adulthood; syphilis, scurvy, smallpox, tuberculosis, typhus and dysentery shortened life expectancy at the time to approximately thirty-five years. The Bubonic Plague took the lives of many and was believed to have been the cause of death for three of William&#39;s seven siblings. Little is known of William&#39;s childhood, other than it is thought that he attended the local grammar school, where he studied Latin and English Literature. In 1582, at the age of eighteen, William married a local farmer&#39;s daughter, Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior and three months pregnant. During their marriage they had three children: Susanna, born on May 26th 1583 and twins, Hamnet and Judith, born on February 2nd 1585. Hamnet, William&#39;s only son, caught Bubonic Plague and died aged just eleven. Five years into his marriage William moved to London and appeared in many small parts at The Globe Theatre, then one of the biggest theatres in England. His first appearance in public as a poet was in 1593 with &#34;Venus and Adonis&#34; and again in the following year with &#34;The Rape of Lucrece&#34;. Six years later, in 1599, he became joint proprietor of The Globe Theatre.When Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, she was succeeded by her cousin King James of Scotland. King James supported Shakespeare and his band of actors and gave them license to call themselves &#34;The King&#39;s Men&#34; in return for entertaining the court. In just twenty-three years, between 1590 and 1613, William Shakespeare is attributed with writing thirty-eight plays, one-hundred-and-fifty-four sonnets and five poems. No original manuscript exists for any of his plays, so it is hard to accurately date them. However, from their contents and reports of the day it is believed that his first play was &#34;The Taming of the Shrew&#34; and that his last complete work was &#34;Two Noble Kinsmen&#34;, written two years before he died. The cause of his death remains unknown. He was buried on April 25th 1616,two days after his death, at the Church of the Holy Trinity (the same Church where he had been baptised fifty-two years earlier). His gravestone bears these words, believed to have been written by William himself:- &#34;Good friend for Jesus sake forbear, To dig the dust enclosed here! Blest be the man that spares these stones, And curst be he that moves my bones&#34; At the time of his death, William had substantial properties, which he bestowed on his family and associates from the theatre. In his will he left his wife, the former Anne Hathaway, his second best bed! William Shakespeare&#39;s last direct descendant died in 1670. She was his granddaughter, Elizabeth.Classical Comics is truly inspirational, creating an accessible and fascinating mix of visual and audible drama. The stage and the page brought vividly to life. Highly recommended for any student of Shakespeare!" Sir Derek Jacobi, Actor &amp; Film Director "I'm fascinated by your approach to the play and its language.

Facing an enthusiastic crowd at the National Association of Realtors' annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Clinton launched the National Partners in Homeownership, a private-public cooperative with one goal: raising the numbers of homeowners across America.</p><p>Determined to reverse what some in Washington saw as a troubling decline of homeownership during the previous decade, Clinton urged private enterprise to join with public agencies to ensure that by the year 2000, some 70 percent of the populace would own their own homes.</p><p>An owner in every home. It was the prosperous, 1990s version of the Depression-era "A Chicken in Every Pot."</p><p>With homeownership standing at around 64 percent, Clinton's program was ambitious. But it was hardly groundbreaking. The U.S. government had often used housing to achieve its public policy goals. Abraham Lincoln's Homestead Act of 1862 gave away public land in the nation's western precincts to individuals committed to developing it. And even earlier, during the Revolutionary War, government land grants were a popular way for an impoverished America to pay soldiers who fought the British.</p><p>Throughout the American experience, a respect, indeed a reverence, for homeownership has been central. The Constitution, as first written, limited the right to vote to white males who owned property, for example. Many colonists came to America because their prospects of becoming landowners were far better in the New World than they were in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe.</p><p>Still, Clinton's homeownership plan differed from its predecessors. The strategy was not a reaction to an economic calamity, as&nbsp;was the case during the Great Depression. Back then, the government created the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which acquired and refinanced one million delinquent mortgages between 1933 and 1936.</p><p>On the contrary, the homeownership strategy of 1994 came about as the economy was rebounding from the recession of 1990 and '91 and about to enter a long period of enviable growth. It also followed an extended era of prosperity for consumer-oriented banks during most of the 1980s when these institutions began extending credit to consumers in a more "democratic" manner for the first time.</p><p>Rather than pursue its homeownership program alone, as it had done in earlier efforts, the government enlisted help in 1995 from a wide swath of American industry. Banks, home builders, securities firms, Realtors&#x2014;all were asked to pull together in a partnership made up of 65 top national organizations and 131 smaller groups.</p><p>The partnership would achieve its goals by "making homeownership more affordable, expanding creative financing, simplifying the home buying process, reducing transaction costs, changing conventional methods of design and building less expensive houses, among other means."</p><p>Amid the hoopla surrounding the partnership announcement, little attention was paid to its unique and most troubling aspect: It was unheard of for regulators to team up this closely with those they were charged with policing.</p><p>And nothing was mentioned about the strategy's ultimate consequence&#x2014;the distortion of the definition of homeownership&#x2014;gutting its role as the mechanism for most families to fund their retirement years or pass on wealth to their children or grandchildren.</p><p>Instead, in just a few short years, all of the venerable rules governing the relationship between borrower and lender went out the window, starting with the elimination of the requirements that a borrower put down a substantial amount of cash in a property, verify his income, and demonstrate an ability to service his debts.</p><p>With baby boomers entering their peak earning years and the number of two-income families on the rise, banks selling Americans on champagne hopes and caviar dreams were about to become the most significant engine of economic growth in the nation. After Congress changed the tax code in 1986, eliminating the deductibility of interest payments on all consumer debt except those charged on home mortgages, the stage was set for housing to become Americans' most favored asset.</p><p>Of course, banks and other private-sector participants in the partnership stood to gain significantly from an increase in homeownership. But nothing as crass as profits came up at the Partners in Homeownership launch. Instead, the focus was on the "deeply-rooted and almost universally held belief that homeownership provides crucial benefits that merit continued public support." These included job creation, financial security (when an individual buys a home that rises in value), and more stable neighborhoods (people don't trash places they own).</p><p>In other words, homeownership for all was a win/win/win.</p><p>A 1995 briefing from the Department of Housing and Urban Development did concede that the validity of the homeownership claims "is so widely accepted that economists and social scientists have seldom tested them." But that note of caution was lost amid bold assertions of homeownership's benefits.</p><p>"When we boost the number of homeowners in our country," Clinton said in a 1995 speech, "we strengthen our economy, create jobs, build up the middle class, and build better citizens."</p><p>Clinton's prediction about the middle class was perhaps the biggest myth of all. Rather than building it up, the Partners in Homeownership wound up decimating the middle class. It left Americans in this large economic group groaning under a mountain of debt and withdrawing cash from their homes as a way to offset stagnant incomes.</p><p>It took a little more than a decade after the partnership's launch for its devastating impact to be felt. By 2008, the American economy was in tatters, jobs were disappearing, and the nation's middle class was imperiled by free-falling home prices and hard-hit retirement accounts. Perhaps most shocking, homeownership was no longer the route to a secure spot in middle-class America. For millions of families, especially those in the lower economic segments of the population, borrowing to buy a home had put them squarely on the road to personal and financial ruin.</p><p>Fueled by dubious industry practices supported by many in Congress and unchecked by most of the regulators charged with oversight of the lending process, the homeownership drive helped to plunge the nation into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p><p>Truly this was an unprecedented partnership.</p><p>But what few have recognized is how the partners in the Clinton program embraced a corrupt corporate model that was also created to promote homeownership. This was the model devised by Fannie Mae, the huge and powerful government-sponsored mortgage finance company set up in 1938 to make it easier for borrowers to buy homes in Depression-ravaged America. Indeed, by the early 1990s, well before the government's partnership drive began, Fannie Mae had perfected the art of manipulating lawmakers, eviscerating its regulators, and enriching its executives. All in the name of expanding homeownership.</p><p>Under the direction of James A. Johnson, Fannie Mae's calculating and politically connected chief executive, the company capitalized on its government ties, building itself into the largest and most powerful financial institution in the world. In 2008, however, the colossus would fail, requiring hundreds of billions in taxpayer backing to keep it afloat. Fannie Mae became the quintessential example of a company whose risk taking allowed its executives to amass great wealth. But when those gambles went awry, the taxpayers had to foot the bill.</p><p>This failure was many years in the making. Beginning in the early 1990s, Johnson's position atop Fannie Mae gave him an extraordinary place astride Washington and Wall Street. His job as chief executive of the company presented him with an extremely powerful policy tool to direct the nation's housing strategy. In his hands, however, that tool became a cudgel. With it, he threatened his enemies and regulators while rewarding his supporters. And, of course, there was the fortune he accrued.</p><p>Perhaps even more important, Johnson's tactics were watched closely and subsequently imitated by others in the private sector, interested in creating their own power and profit machines. Fannie Mae led the way in relaxing loan underwriting standards, for example, a shift that was quickly followed by private lenders. Johnson's company also automated the lending process so that loan decisions could be made in minutes and were based heavily on a borrower's credit history, rather than on a more comprehensive financial profile as had been the case in the past.</p><p>Eliminating the traditional due diligence conducted by lenders soon became the playbook for financial executives across the country. Wall Street, always ready to play the role of enabler, provided the money for these dubious loans, profiting mightily. Without the Wall Street firms giving billions of dollars to reckless lenders, hundreds of billions of bad loans would never have been made.</p><p>Finally, Fannie Mae's aggressive lobbying and its methods for neutering regulators and opponents were also copied by much of the financial industry. Regulators across the country were either beaten back or lulled into complacency by the banks they were supposed to police.</p><p>How Clinton's calamitous Homeownership Strategy was born, nurtured, and finally came to blow up the American economy is the story of greed and good intentions, corporate corruption and government support. It is also a story of pretty lies told by politicians, company executi...</p></p><h2>African Politics and Society: A Mosaic in Transformation</h2><p>AFRICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY: A MOSAIC IN TRANSFORMATION is the first single-authored textbook to examine continuity and change in African politics and society from the pre-colonial era to the present. It fills the needs of those with little prior knowledge while balancing this background information with thorough analysis for those already familiar with the subject. An emphasis has been placed on making sense of general developments on the African continent as a whole while introducing the distinctive natures of Africa&#39;s 53 countries. Each chapter emphasizes the major trends associated with a topic, trends that are further explored through illustrative case studies that represent all regions of the African continent. Each chapter concludes with a list of readings for further exploration and research. Numerous maps, tables, figures, and boxed elements highlight fundamental issues of interest. Because each chapter stands alone, instructors can assign chapters that relate topics that are of greatest relevance to the course or reorder chapters to better suit their syllabi.</p><p><b>Peter J. Schraeder </b>is Associate Professor of Political Science at Loyola University.<br>This is the first contemporary, comprehensive, and single-authored textbook to scrutinize continuity and change in African politics and society from precolonial times to the present, with particular emphasis on the post-Cold War era. Based on extensive research and travels to Africa that included research meetings, interviews, and discussions with African intellectuals and commoners, the book is divided into six major parts. Each part is then subdivided into chapters that explain African politics and society by exploring the general evolution of rival theoretical perspectives, the historical context, the sociocultural context of current trends, continuity and change in governance, and foreign relations during the contemporary independence era. Easy to comprehend and thoroughly intriguing, Schraeder's (political science, Loyola Univ.) book sheds light on our understanding of the complex social, economic, and political environment of contemporary Africa and is well worth debating. This book lists a wide variety of print and electronic research resources and also includes an appendix with a country-by-country list of 128 introductory volumes, bibliographies, and historical dictionaries. A most valuable contribution to African studies.AEdward G.

He lives in Gladwyne, PA.ONE<br><br>The<br><br>Conjecturers<br><br>The Glory That Was Greece<br><br>&#x201c;In all history,&#x201d; the philosopher Bertrand Russell has said, &#x201c;nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account for as the sudden rise of civilization in Greece.&#x201d;<br><br>Until the sixth century b.c., the Greeks borrowed much of their culture from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and neighboring countries, but from the sixth to the fourth centuries they generated a stupendous body of new and distinctive cultural materials. Among other things, they created sophisticated new forms of literature, art, and architecture, wrote the first real histories (as opposed to mere annals), invented mathematics and science, developed schools and gymnasiums, and originated democratic government. Much of subsequent Western culture has been the lineal descendant of theirs; in particular, much of philosophy and science during the past twenty-five hundred years has been the outgrowth of the Greek philosophers&#x2019; attempts to understand the nature of the world. Above all, the story of psychology is the narrative of a continuing effort to answer the questions they first asked about the human mind.<br><br>It is mystifying that the Greek philosophers so suddenly began to theorize about human mental processes in psychological, or at least quasi-psychological, terms. For while the 150 or so Greek city-states around the Mediterranean had noble temples, elegant statues and fountains, and bustling marketplaces, living conditions in them were in many respects primitive and not, one would suppose, conducive to subtle psychological inquiry.<br><br>Few people could read or write; those who could had to scratch laboriously on wax tablets or, for permanent records, on strips of papyrus or parchment twenty to thirty feet long wrapped around a stick. Books&#x2014;actually, hand-copied scrolls&#x2014;were costly, rare, and awkward to use.<br><br>The Greeks, possessing neither clocks nor watches, had but a rudimentary sense of time. Sundials offered only approximations, were not transportable, and were of no help in cloudy weather; the water clocks used to limit oratory in court were merely bowls filled with water that emptied through a hole in about six minutes.<br><br>Lighting, such as it was, was provided by flickering oil lamps. A few of the well-to-do had bathrooms with running water, but most people, lacking water to wash with, cleansed themselves by rubbing their bodies with oil and then scraping it off with a crescent-shaped stick. (Fortunately, some three hundred days a year were sunny, and Athenians lived out of doors most of the time.) Few city streets were paved; most were dirt roads, dusty in dry weather and muddy in wet. Transport consisted of pack mules or springless, bone-bruising horse- drawn wagons. News was sometimes conveyed by fire beacons or carrier pigeons, but most often by human runners.<br><br>Illustrious Athens, the center of Greek culture, could not feed itself; the surrounding plains had poor soil, the hills and mountains were stony and infertile. The Athenians obtained much of their food through maritime commerce and conquest. (Athens established a number of colonies, and at times dominated the Aegean, receiving tribute from other city-states.) But while their ships had sails, the Athenians knew only how to rig them to be driven by a following wind; to proceed crosswind or into the wind or in a calm, they forced slaves to strain hour after hour at banks of oars, driving the ships at most eight miles per hour. The armies thus borne to far shores to advance Athenian interests fought much like their primitive ancestors, with spears, swords, and bows and arrows.<br><br>Slaves also provided most of the power in Greek workshops and silver mines; human muscles, feeble as they are compared to modern machinery, were, aside from beasts of burden, the only source of kinetic energy. Slavery was, in fact, the economic foundation of the Greek city-states; men, women, and children captured abroad by Greek armies made up much of the population of many cities. Even in democratic Athens and the neighboring associated towns of Attica, at least 115,000 of the 315,000 inhabitants were slaves. Of the 200,000 free Athenians only the forty-three thousand men who had been born to two Athenian parents possessed all civil rights, including the right to vote.<br><br>All in all, it was not a way of life in which one would expect reflective and searching philosophy, or its subdiscipline, psychology, to flourish.<br><br>What, then, accounts for the Greeks&#x2019; astonishing intellectual accomplishments, and for those of the Athenians in particular? Some have half-seriously suggested the climate; Cicero said that Athens&#x2019; clear air contributed to the keenness of the Attic mind. Certain present-day analysts have hypothesized that the Athenians&#x2019; living outdoors much of the time, in constant conversation with one another, induced questioning and thinking. Others have argued that commerce and conquest, bringing Athenians and other Greeks into contact with many other cultures, made them curious about the origin of human differences. Still others have said that the mix of cultural influences in the Greek city-states gave Greek culture a kind of hybrid vigor. Finally, some have pragmatically suggested that when civilization had developed to the point where day-to-day survival did not take up every hour of the day, human beings for the first time had leisure in which to theorize about their motives and thoughts, and those of other people.<br><br>None of these explanations is really satisfactory, although perhaps all of them taken together, along with still others, are. Athens reached the zenith of its greatness, its Golden Age (480 to 399), after it and its allies defeated the Persians. Victory, wealth, and the need to rebuild the temples on the Acropolis that the Persian leader Xerxes had burned, in addition to the favorable influences mentioned above, may have produced a kind of cultural critical mass and an explosion of creativity.<br><br>The Forerunners<br><br>Along with their many other speculations, a number of the Greek philosophers of the sixth and early fifth centuries began proposing naturalistic explanations of human mental processes; these hypotheses and their derivatives have been at the core of Western psychology ever since.<br><br>What kinds of persons were they? What caused or at least enabled them to think about human cognition in this radically new fashion? We know their names&#x2014;Thales, Alcmaeon, Empedocles, Anaxogoras, Hippocrates, Democritus, and others&#x2014;but about many of them we know little else; about the others what we know consists largely of hagiography and legend.<br><br>We read, for instance, that Thales of Miletus (624&#x2013;546), first of the philosophers, was an absentminded dreamer who, studying the nighttime heavens, could be so absorbed in glorious thoughts as to tumble ingloriously into a ditch. We read, too, that he paid no heed to money until, tired of being mocked for his poverty, he used his astrological expertise one winter to foretell a bumper crop of olives, cheaply leased all the oil presses in the area, and later, at harvest time, charged top prices for their use.<br><br>Gossipy chroniclers tell us that Empedocles (500?&#x2013;430), of Acragas in southern Sicily, had such vast scientific knowledge that he could control the winds and once brought back to life a woman who had been dead for thirty days. Believing himself a god, in his old age he leaped into Etna in order to die without leaving a human trace; as some later poetaster jested, &#x201c;Great Empedocles, that ardent soul / Leaped into Etna, and was roasted whole.&#x201d; But Etna vomited his brazen slippers back onto the rim of the crater and thereby proclaimed him mortal.<br><br>Such details hardly help us fathom the psychophilosophers, if we may so call them. Nor did any of them set down an account&#x2014;at least, none exists&#x2014;of how or why they became interested in the workings of the mind. We can only suppose that in the dawn of philosophy, when thoughtful men began to ask all sorts of searching questions about the nature of the world and of humankind, it was natural that they would also ask how their own thoughts about such things arose and where their ideas came from.<br><br>One or two did actual research that touched on the physical equipment involved in psychological processes. Alcmaeon (fl. 520), a physician of Croton in southern Italy, performed dissections on animals (dissecting the human body was taboo) and discovered the optic nerve, connecting the eye to the brain. Most, however, were neither hands-on investigators nor experimentalists but men of leisure, who, starting with self-evident truths and their own observations of everyday phenomena, sought to deduce the nature of the world and of the mind.<br><br>The psychophilosophers most often carried on their reasoning while strolling or sitting with their students in the marketplaces of their cities or courtyards of their academies, endlessly debating the questions that intrigued them. And probably, like Thales gazing at the stars, they also spent periods alone in deep meditation. But little remains of the fruits of their labors; nearly all copies of their writings were lost or destroyed. Most of what we know of their thinking comes from brief citations in the works of later writers. Yet even these bits and pieces indicate that they asked a number of the major questions&#x2014;to which they offered some sensible and some outlandish answers&#x2014;that have concerned psychologists ever since.<br><br>We can surmise from the few obscure and tantalizing allusions by later writers to the philosophers&#x2019; ideas that among the questions they asked themselves concerning nous (which they variously identified as soul, mind, or both) were what its nature is (what it is made of), and how so seemingly intangible an entity could be connected to and influence the body.<br><br>Thales pondered these matters, although a single sentence in Aristotle&#x2019;s De Anima (On the Soul) is the only surviving record of those thoughts: &#x201c;Judging...</p><h2>Introduction to Plasma Theory</h2><p>Provides a complete introduction to plasma physics as taught in a 1-year graduate course.

No longer simply the study of timeless masterpieces, art history as a discipline is now addressing some of the most basic questions about cultural production, questions such as how images function and how expectations and social factors mediate what we see. The new scope of art history has required a major expansion and reassessment of methods and terminology.<br><br>Edited by Robert Nelson and Richard Shiff, <i>Critical Terms for Art History</i> is both an exposition and a demonstration of contested terms from the current art historical vocabulary. In individual essays, scholars examine the history and use of these terms by grounding their discussions in single works of art, reading each work through current debates and methods. This instructive combination of theory and practice allows readers to examine the terms as they are seeing them employed. In its wide representation of contemporary discourse, <i>Critical Terms for Art History</i> is a comprehensive effort to map historical and theoretical debates over the visual environment.<br><br>Like its companion, <i>Critical Terms for Literary Study,</i> this book will prove an invaluable resource both for those beginning to learn about the visual theory and for scholars and historians.<br></p><p>"Art" has always been contested terrain, whether the object in question is a medieval tapestry or Duchamp's <i>Fountain</i>. But questions about the categories of "art" and "art history" acquired increased urgency during the 1970s, when new developments in critical theory and other intellectual projects dramatically transformed the discipline. The first edition of <i>Critical Terms for Art History</i> both mapped and contributed to those transformations, offering a spirited reassessment of the field's methods and terminology.<br><br>Art history as a field has kept pace with debates over globalization and other social and political issues in recent years, making a second edition of this book not just timely, but crucial. Like its predecessor, this new edition consists of essays that cover a wide variety of "loaded" terms in the history of art, from <i>sign</i> to <i>meaning</i>, <i>ritual</i> to <i>commodity</i>. Each essay explains and comments on a single term, discussing the issues the term raises and putting the term into practice as an interpretive framework for a specific work of art. For example, Richard Shiff discusses "Originality" in Vija Celmins's <i>To Fix the Image in Memory</i>, a work made of eleven pairs of stones, each consisting of one "original" stone and one painted bronze replica. <br><br>In addition to the twenty-two original essays, this edition includes nine new ones&#x2014;<i>performance</i>, <i>style</i>, <i>memory/monument</i>, <i>body</i>, <i>beauty</i>, <i>ugliness</i>, <i>identity</i>, <i>visual culture/visual studies</i>, and <i>social history of art</i>&#x2014;as well as new introductory material. All help expand the book's scope while retaining its central goal of stimulating discussion of theoretical issues in art history and making that discussion accessible to both beginning students and senior scholars.<br><br>Contributors: Mark Antliff, Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, Stephen Bann, Homi K.

First published in November 1899 it is the originator of concepts such as the Oedipus complex and the notion, now taken for granted, that our daily lives are governed not only by conscious decisions but by unconscious pressures. Although it inaugurated the new practice of psychoanalysis, its most lasting impact has been on our social and cultural outlook, on how we interpret literature and art, and on the language in which we do so.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>The EQ Edge: Emotional Intelligence and Your Success</h2><p><b>REVISED AND UPDAT ED WITH NEW RESEARCH INTO EQ AND PERSONAL AND CAREER SUCCESS</b> <p>What is the formula for success at your job?

But the familiar story is brought to new life in this gorgeous edition, a collaboration between the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art and artist Yayoi Kusama.</p><p>Paired with Hans Christian Andersen&#x2019;s original text, the densely patterned, undulating line drawings of Kusama&#x2019;s <em>Love Forever</em> series (2004&#x2013;7) conjure up storms in the roiling waves of the ocean, the Little Mermaid&#x2019;s vast underwater kingdom and her longing to live in the human world. Kusama&#x2019;s fertile, endlessly repeating forms are an ideal match for the poetic and disturbing universe evoked in the fairy tale; the result is a true collaboration. Kusama&#x2019;s drawings both illustrate and interpret Andersen&#x2019;s story, bringing it to terrifying life, and Andersen&#x2019;s words lend narrative content to Kusama&#x2019;s landscapes of unblinking eyes, curling tendrils and disembodied profiles.</p><p><strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong> (born 1929) first left Japan at the age of 28, landing in late 1950s New York. Her oeuvre, now spanning more than 50 years, includes painting, performance, installations and environments, sculpture, film, fashion, design and literary work. She was recently named the world&#x2019;s most popular artist, based on annual figures reported by <em>The Art Newspaper</em> for global museum attendance in 2014.</p></p><p>Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese artist who works in many mediums and is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Praemium Imperiale. She is the author of &#34;Hustlers Grotto of Christopher Street&#34;, among other books.Kusama's evocative drawings pave the way for new readings of the classic fairytale while the collaboration emphasizes the depth of Anderson's knowledge of the human condition and his understanding of human relationships. (<i>Art and Auction</i>)<br><br>Her bold, undulating lines, however, bring Andersen&#x2019;s narrative to life, covering pages with waving and wriggling patterns; fanciful plants suggestive of wondrous aquatic wildlife; motifs resembling tentacles and waves; and an abundance of enigmatic, watchful eyes. The repetition of shapes and doodled figures forms a fluid stream of images around Andersen&#x2019;s prose, giving it new and exciting energy. The images and text build a world that might just be as fantastic and mysterious as the one that the little mermaid saw when she ascended from the depths of the sea for the first time. (Claire Voon <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>Kusama&nbsp;not&nbsp;only&nbsp;managed&nbsp;to&nbsp;incorporate&nbsp;her&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;style&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;mesmerizing&nbsp;images, but&nbsp;she&nbsp;has&nbsp;also&nbsp;masterfully&nbsp;captured&nbsp;the&nbsp;intriguing&nbsp;and&nbsp;inspiring&nbsp;children&#x2019;s&nbsp;story. (German Henry <i>Sleek</i>)<br><br>At once whimsical and foreboding, the images perfectly capture the twisted imagination of <i>The Little Mermaid&#x2019;s</i> writer. (Priscilla Frank <i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>Anderson's story is enhanced by Kusama's unique landscapes and Kusama's visuals are given new life within the narrative context. A harmonious collaboration, indeed.

Original.</p><p>To the ordinary person, who hasn't spent three years grinding through law school, legalese gets its point across as clearly and effortlessly as a dose of ancient Greek. Right up there with medical lingo, legal jargon confuses and alienates folks, makes them feel stupid and ill at ease. A translation or two, however, can go a long way toward clearing the legal air. With concise and sensible definitions, <i>Merriam Webster's Dictionary of Law</i> converts a lease, will, or summons into standard English, and removes the intimidation factor from what is, basically, an effort at reliable communication. Been wondering about tortfeasors and arrears, peculation and naked promises, John Doe summonses and Terry stops? From ABA (American Bar Association) to Zone of Privacy ("an area or aspect of life that is held to be protected from intrusion by a specific constitutional guarantee"), the dictionary defines and explains 10,000 legal terms, allowing a ready grasp of laws, statutes, and legal procedures to anyone who knows how to crack open a dictionary.<p> Despite the title, the book is more than a mere dictionary. There's a chapter explaining the United States judicial system, a chapter discussing important legal cases, and another summarizing important laws. There's also a section on important legal agencies in the U.S., followed by the full Constitution of the United States, making this a useful family legal reference, adding clarity to news reports, assisting with homework assignments, simplifying potentially scary legal actions, and making government agencies, civil rights, and legal options less daunting and more accessible. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Merriam Webster Inc, Springfield, MA</p><h2>ECONOMICS TEACHERS EDITION</h2><p><p>Generously illustrated and easy to follow, Economics lays the foundation for economic thinking and the ability to make informed choices in the national and international marketplace.

Paideia, the shaping of Greek character through a union of civilization, tradition, literature, and philosophy is the basis for Jaeger's evaluation of Hellenic culture.<br>Volume I describes the foundation, growth, and crisis of Greek culture during the archaic and classical epochs, ending with the collapse of the Athenian empire. The second and third volumes of the work deal with the intellectual history of ancient Greece in the Age of Plato, the 4th century B.C.--the age in which Greece lost everything that is valued in this world--state, power, liberty--but still clung to the concept of paideia. As its last great poet, Menander summarized the primary role of this ideal in Greek culture when he said: "The possession which no one can take away from man is paideia."<br></p><p>The final volume of Werner Jaeger&#39;s three-volume Paideia begins at the same point as its predecessor--the fall of the Periclean empire--but pursues a different line of intellectual development.Werner Jaeger is formerly of Harvard University and the Institute for Classical Studies.</p><h2>Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit is Transforming the Public Sector (Plume)</h2><p>"A landmark in the debate on the future of public policy."&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i>.</p><p><b>David Osborne</b>, managing partner of The Public Strategies Group, has served as an advisor to Vice President Al Gore, a consultant to America?s public sector managers and a counselor to leaders worldwide. He lives in Essex, Massachusetts.An inspiring, well-organized exposition of ten principles that appear to offer hope for renewal in an era of government decline. Osborne's Laboratories of Democracy (1988) celebrated government innovation at state and local levels; here, the ideas are further developed, with many more examples and a sharper focus. Osborne and Gaebler (the former city manager of Visalia, California) charge that government bureaucracy, created a hundred years ago to combat official corruption, has outlived its usefulness. Since governments are increasingly caught between declining revenues and rising demands for service, the authors call on them to become more ``catalytic,'' ``mission-driven,'' ``customer-driven,'' ``anticipatory,'' ``market-oriented,'' etc. The authors recognize that these terms may have a vaguely threatening ring to many liberals and public employees, but they counter those fears with examples of how the adoption of these principles has resulted in employee empowerment, increased public support, etc. For example, they explain how, when Phoenix forced its trash collectors to compete with private businesses while guaranteeing the collectors' jobs, morale and productivity soared. Most convincing is the way Osborne and Gaebler discuss honestly the most serious potential problems with their proposals--e.g., their refusal to endorse merit pay for individual teachers, which, they admit, may set up cutthroat situations. Analyzing the successful experiments, they provide theory for political scientists to chew on and examples for government officials to consider--e.g., that of Visalia, which uses bonuses to reward groups of employees more often than individuals ``on the theory that individual rewards encourage people to hoard information and compete with one another, while group rewards encourage people to share information and work together.''

Yet even those who have marveled at Serra's intellectually rigorous and large works of sculpture may not be familiar with his equally intriguing drawings. This handsome book brings together for the first time Serra's drawn work, considering the artist's investigation of medium as an activity both independent from and linked to his pioneering sculptural practice. </p><p>First working in ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper, Serra originally used drawing as a means to explore form and perceptual relations between his sculpture and the viewer. Over time, his drawings underwent significant shifts in concept, materials, and scale and became fully realized and autonomous works of art. The grand, bold forms he created with black paintstick in his monumental Installation Drawings were designed to disrupt and complement existent spaces and eventually began to occupy entire rooms. In the late 1980s, Serra explored the tension of weight and gravity through layering, and his most recent work experiments with surface effects, using mesh screens as intermediaries between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to paper.</p></p><p><b>Lizzie Borden</b> is a filmmaker and writer based in Los Angeles. <b>Magdalena Dabrowski</b> is a Special Consultant for Modern and Contemporary Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. <b>Gary Garrels</b> is the Elise S.

When the heir to the Baskerville fortune, Sir Henry, also comes under threat Holmes&#x2019; detective skills are put to the test as he battles to discover the truth behind the legend and to solve one of the most macabre mysteries of his career.</p></p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p>
